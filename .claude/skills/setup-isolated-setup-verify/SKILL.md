description: |
  Walk the verification checklist for the framework's secure
  agent setup and report ✓ done / ✗ missing / ⚠ partial for
  each check, with concrete evidence (file paths, command
  output, version strings). Coverage: settings.json wiring,
  claude-iso sourced, pinned tool versions, denial commands.
  Read-only — never modifies anything.
when_to_use: |
  Invoke when the user says "verify my secure setup", "is my
  secure config done?", "check that the secure agent setup is
  installed", "did setup work?", or after running
  `setup-isolated-setup-install` to confirm the install landed completely.
  Also appropriate as a routine — after every Claude Code upgrade,
  after every project / user-scope `settings.json` edit, and any
  time a previously-blocked Bash call appears to have succeeded
  (the "did a denial silently turn into an allow?" canary). Cheap
  to re-run; never destructive.

# setup-isolated-setup-verify

This skill is the **assertion** layer over the secure setup. It
runs the checklist documented in
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → Verification → Via a Claude Code prompt](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#via-a-claude-code-prompt-1)
and reports each check's status to the user with concrete evidence
(file paths, command output, version strings).

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented
below, this skill consults
[`.apache-steward-overrides/setup-isolated-setup-verify.md`](../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any
agent-readable overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract — what overrides may contain, hard
rules, the reconciliation flow on framework upgrade,
upstreaming guidance.

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-steward/`. Local modifications
go in the override file. Framework changes go via PR
to `apache/airflow-steward`.

---

## Snapshot drift

Also at the top of every run, this skill compares the
gitignored `.apache-steward.local.lock` (per-machine
fetch) against the committed `.apache-steward.lock`
(the project pin). On mismatch the skill surfaces the
gap and proposes
[`/setup-steward upgrade`](../setup-steward/upgrade.md).
The proposal is non-blocking — the user may defer if
they want to run with the local snapshot for now. See
[`docs/setup/install-recipes.md` § Subsequent runs and drift detection](../../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md#subsequent-runs-and-drift-detection)
for the full flow.

Drift severity:

- **method or URL differ** → ✗ full re-install needed.
- **ref differs** (project bumped tag, or `git-branch`
  local is behind upstream tip) → ⚠ sync needed.
- **`svn-zip` SHA-512 mismatches the committed
  anchor** → ✗ security-flagged; investigate before
  upgrading.

---
## Golden rules

- **Read-only.** This skill does not edit any file, copy any
  script, install any package, or modify any settings. If a check
  surfaces a missing or misconfigured piece, surface the gap and
  point at the install path (`setup-isolated-setup-install` for a missing
  install, `setup-isolated-setup-update` for drift); do not auto-fix.
- **Report every check, even on early failure.** Do not stop at
  the first ✗ — the value of the report is in the full picture.
  If check 3 fails, continue to checks 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 anyway and
  surface every gap so the user can address them in one round.
- **Distinguish ✗ (missing) from ⚠ (variant or drift).** A missing
  hook script is ✗. A user installing the doc-allowed "richer
  custom statusLine" path that embeds the framework's
  sandbox-prefix logic into a larger script is ⚠ (the by-name
  helper is not present, but the equivalent functionality is). Use
  ⚠ for any *intentional* variation from the doc default; ✗ only
  for genuine gaps.
- **Surface evidence.** Each check's report line names the file
  path, the version string, the command output, the
  `sandbox.enabled` value — never just "✓" or "✗" alone.

## The 8 checks

The canonical list lives in
[docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md → Verification → Via a Claude Code prompt](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#via-a-claude-code-prompt-1).
Walk each in order:

1. Project `.claude/settings.json` shape — `sandbox.enabled: true`,
   `permissions.deny`, `permissions.ask`, `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`.
2. User-scope `~/.claude/settings.json` wiring — `PreToolUse`
   `Bash` matcher → `sandbox-bypass-warn.sh`, `PostToolUse`
   `Bash` matcher → `sandbox-error-hint.sh`, `statusLine` →
   `sandbox-status-line.sh` (or a custom statusline script that
   embeds the framework's prefix logic — that is the doc-allowed
   variant; report ⚠). A missing `PostToolUse` entry for
   `sandbox-error-hint.sh` reports ⚠ (not ✗) — the hook is a
   discoverability aid for the failure modes catalogued in
   [`docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md`](../../../docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md);
   absence does not break anything, it just means an adopter
   hitting one of those failures sees the raw error without the
   `[sandbox-hint]` annotation.
3. Hook scripts present + executable — all three of
   `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-bypass-warn.sh`,
   `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-error-hint.sh`, and
   `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-status-line.sh`. Symlinks into a
   `~/.claude-config` sync repo are equivalent to direct files;
   resolve the link target and check that. ⚠ (not ✗) for a
   missing `sandbox-error-hint.sh`, with the same rationale as
   check 2.
4. `claude-iso` shell function defined + sourced. The grep
   pattern is the source line in `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`. Check
   whether `alias claude='claude-iso'` is set; report it as a
   note (it is optional per the doc).
5. Pinned tool versions installed match
   `tools/agent-isolation/pinned-versions.toml`. On macOS,
   skip `bubblewrap` and `socat` (Seatbelt is built-in); only
   check `claude-code`. Report drift in either direction —
   newer-than-pin or older-than-pin — as ⚠.
6. Status-line prefix in this session is `[sandbox]`, not
   `[NO SANDBOX]`. Resolve the precedence:
   `<cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` →
   `<cwd>/.claude/settings.json` →
   `~/.claude/settings.local.json` →
   `~/.claude/settings.json`; report the `sandbox.enabled` value
   from each.
7. Denial commands actually deny. **Important: run each as a
   standalone Bash invocation**, not as a chained pipeline —
   `permissions.deny` patterns match only on the *first* command
   of a Bash tool call, so a chained `curl` later in the
   pipeline can slip past on macOS (where there is no socat
   network proxy as a backstop). The three commands are:
   - `cat ~/.aws/credentials` — should deny with
     `Operation not permitted` (Seatbelt) or
     `No such file or directory` (bubblewrap).
   - `echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — should print empty (claude-iso
     stripped the env).
   - `curl https://example.com` — should deny at the
     permission-prompt layer
     (`Permission to use Bash with command curl … has been denied`).

8. **Project-root coverage in the sandbox allowlists** (defensive
   against the harness behaviour in
   [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/airflow-steward/issues/197):
   `allowRead: ["."]` does not in practice cover CWD because the
   read side pre-resolves `.` at session start and drops the
   literal). Two sub-checks:

   - **Static:** for the current working tree, confirm its
     absolute path appears in both
     `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`'s
     `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` and
     `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`. For every other linked
     worktree in `git worktree list --porcelain`, run the same
     check against *that* worktree's own
     `.claude/settings.local.json` — each worktree carries its
     own entry. Surface ✗ on any missing entry; remediation:
     `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh --all-worktrees`
     (or re-run `/setup-isolated-setup-install` if the helper is
     not installed).
   - **Live probe:** attempt a sandboxed read of `.git/HEAD` and
     a sandboxed write of a temp file inside the *current*
     worktree's project root (e.g.
     `<root>/.steward-verify-probe.tmp`, removed immediately
     after the write). The write should succeed because
     `allowWrite` keeps `.` literal at access-time; the read is
     the one that actually exercises the harness bug this check
     exists to defend against. ✗ on either failure; remediation
     as above.

   The check is cheap (read of a known file, write of a single
   temp file) and the false-negative cost (a session that can't
   read the project) is high, so it runs every time
   `setup-isolated-setup-verify` is invoked — no flag needed to
   opt in.

   Note: this check looks at **project-local**
   (`<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`), not user-scope.
   The fix lives there deliberately — see
   [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Project-root coverage in the sandbox allowlists*](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#project-root-coverage-in-the-sandbox-allowlists)
   for why.

   **Scope detection (per-project vs whole-user).** The install
   skill offers two scopes. Detect which one is in effect:

   ```bash
   git config --global --get core.hooksPath
   ```

   If the output equals `$HOME/.claude/git-hooks` (or its tilde-
   resolved form), the operator is in **whole-user** scope:

   - ✓ if `~/.claude/git-hooks/post-checkout` exists, is
     executable, and matches the framework's
     `tools/agent-isolation/git-global-post-checkout.sh` content.
   - ⚠ if the hook is missing or non-executable — the `core.hooksPath`
     pointer is set but the hook content is gone. Remediation:
     re-run `/setup-isolated-setup-install` Step P.3-whole-user,
     or `/setup-isolated-setup-update` to refresh the script copy.
   - ⚠ if the hook content drifted from the framework's source-of-
     truth — surface the diff, propose `/setup-isolated-setup-update`.
   - **Loud reminder** (every run, not a ✗): when in whole-user
     scope, surface a one-line note that per-repo `.git/hooks/*`
     are inert across the host (per [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Per-project vs whole-user scope*](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#per-project-vs-whole-user-scope)).
     This is informational, not a failure — the operator chose it
     deliberately during install. Surface so a future self
     debugging "why didn't my pre-commit fire" recognises the
     cause.

   If `core.hooksPath` is unset (or points elsewhere), the
   operator is in **per-project** scope (the default). No further
   sub-check needed — the per-project mode is fully covered by
   the static + live-probe checks above.

## After the report

If every check is ✓, say so explicitly and stop — no further
suggestion needed.

If anything is ✗ or ⚠, suggest the appropriate follow-up skill
without invoking it:

- ✗ on checks 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 → `setup-isolated-setup-install` (missing
  install pieces).
- ⚠ on check 5 (pinned-version drift) or any user-scope script
  copy that is older than the framework's source-of-truth →
  `setup-isolated-setup-update`.
- ✗ on check 8 (project root missing from the current
  worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json`, or the live probe
  fails) → if `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh`
  is installed, re-run it with `--all-worktrees`; otherwise
  re-run `setup-isolated-setup-install` to install the helper
  and add the paths in one pass.
- The user-scope script copies live under `~/.claude-config/`
  for users who maintain that sync repo; uncommitted local edits
  there → `setup-shared-config-sync`.
