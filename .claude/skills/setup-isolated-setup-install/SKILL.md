description: |
  Guide an adopter through the first-time install of the
  framework's secure agent setup (bubblewrap + socat +
  claude-code, sandbox/permissions/clean-env layers). Walks
  every step interactively; never auto-runs sudo, shell-rc
  edits, or settings overwrites.
when_to_use: |
  Invoke when the user says "set up the secure agent setup",
  "first-time install of the secure config", "install the
  secure setup in this tracker", "walk me through the
  secure-agent-setup install", or starts working on a fresh
  adopter clone without secure-config wiring. Also appropriate
  after a fresh OS install / new dev machine where
  `~/.claude/scripts/` is empty. Skip when the secure setup is
  already in place — use `setup-isolated-setup-verify` (to
  confirm completeness) or `setup-isolated-setup-update` (to
  refresh against the framework's latest) instead.

# setup-isolated-setup-install

This skill is the **on-ramp** for adopters who do not yet have the
secure setup running. It is a thin walkthrough wrapper around the
canonical install path documented in
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md`](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md). The
authoritative content lives there; this skill exists so an adopter
can say *"set up the secure agent setup"* in a fresh session and
land in the right step-by-step flow without first reading the
document.

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented
below, this skill consults
[`.apache-steward-overrides/setup-isolated-setup-install.md`](../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any
agent-readable overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract — what overrides may contain, hard
rules, the reconciliation flow on framework upgrade,
upstreaming guidance.

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-steward/`. Local modifications
go in the override file. Framework changes go via PR
to `apache/airflow-steward`.

---

## Snapshot drift

Also at the top of every run, this skill compares the
gitignored `.apache-steward.local.lock` (per-machine
fetch) against the committed `.apache-steward.lock`
(the project pin). On mismatch the skill surfaces the
gap and proposes
[`/setup-steward upgrade`](../setup-steward/upgrade.md).
The proposal is non-blocking — the user may defer if
they want to run with the local snapshot for now. See
[`docs/setup/install-recipes.md` § Subsequent runs and drift detection](../../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md#subsequent-runs-and-drift-detection)
for the full flow.

Drift severity:

- **method or URL differ** → ✗ full re-install needed.
- **ref differs** (project bumped tag, or `git-branch`
  local is behind upstream tip) → ⚠ sync needed.
- **`svn-zip` SHA-512 mismatches the committed
  anchor** → ✗ security-flagged; investigate before
  upgrading.

---
## Golden rules

- **Do not auto-run privilege-elevating commands.** Anything that
  needs `sudo` (apt / dnf installs, system-wide writes) is *printed*
  for the user to copy-paste into their own terminal. The skill
  never invokes `sudo` itself.
- **Do not edit shell rc files without approval.** `~/.bashrc` /
  `~/.zshrc` modifications (sourcing `claude-iso.sh`, the optional
  `alias claude='claude-iso'`) are surfaced as the exact line to
  add; the user pastes it themselves. The skill confirms the rc
  file path with the user first; it does not assume.
- **Do not overwrite an existing settings file silently.** If the
  user already has a project `.claude/settings.json` or a
  user-scope `~/.claude/settings.json`, the skill *diffs* the
  desired merge against the existing file and asks for explicit
  approval before writing. Re-installs / partial-state recoveries
  are common — the skill must not blow away an unrelated
  pre-existing hook or `permissions.ask` rule.
- **Stop on the first failure.** If a step fails (manifest read
  fails, framework path wrong, an existing file conflicts in a way
  the user has not yet decided about), stop and report. Do not
  push past a failure to the next step.

## Up-front confirmations

Before walking any install step, confirm with the user:

1. **OS / distro.** macOS, Ubuntu / Debian (apt), Fedora / RHEL
   (dnf), or Arch / NixOS / other. macOS skips bubblewrap +
   socat (Seatbelt is built-in); Linux installs both per the
   distro shortcut.
2. **Framework checkout path.** The path to the user's local
   `airflow-steward` clone. Required to read
   `tools/agent-isolation/pinned-versions.toml`,
   `.claude/settings.json`, and the
   `tools/agent-isolation/*.sh` scripts. If the user does not
   have a clone, walk them through `git clone` first.
3. **Fresh install or re-install.** For a re-install on a partial
   existing state, the skill must enumerate the existing wiring
   (project settings.json, user settings.json, hooks dir,
   shell rc) before any merge so the user knows what is being
   preserved vs replaced.
4. **Sync repo (optional).** Whether the user maintains a
   private dotfile-style `~/.claude-config` repo per
   [Syncing user-scope config across machines](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#syncing-user-scope-config-across-machines).
   If yes, the skill installs user-scope scripts as **symlinks**
   into `~/.claude-config/scripts/` rather than `cp`-ing into
   `~/.claude/scripts/` — the symlink approach is what makes
   sync push the upgrades to other machines automatically.

## Walk-through

Follow the canonical step list at
[docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md → Adopter setup → Via a Claude Code prompt](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#via-a-claude-code-prompt).
Each step in that list maps 1:1 to a step in this skill. Do not
re-write the list here — read the doc, follow it, and surface each
sub-step with the user. The doc names are the source of truth; the
skill is the runner.

For the verification step at the end, hand off to the
`setup-isolated-setup-verify` skill rather than re-walking the checklist
inline.

### Step P — Project-root coverage in the sandbox allowlists

Per
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Project-root coverage in the sandbox allowlists*](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#project-root-coverage-in-the-sandbox-allowlists)
and [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/airflow-steward/issues/197),
the harness pre-resolves `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead: ["."]` at
session start in a way that silently drops the literal `.` from the
resolved set, so a session in a freshly-cloned adopter repo can
write to CWD but cannot **read** from it under the sandbox.

The defensive measure is to add the project root as an explicit
**absolute path** to `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` and `allowWrite`
in the adopter's **project-local** settings file
(`<repo>/.claude/settings.local.json`) — gitignored, per-machine,
per-project, merged on top of the committed project-scope and
user-scope by the harness. Worktrees handle themselves: each
worktree has its own `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`,
and each gets its own root added.

#### Step P.0 — Ask the user: per-project or whole-user scope?

Before installing anything, ask the operator which scope they
want — see
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Per-project vs whole-user scope*](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#per-project-vs-whole-user-scope)
for the full rationale + trade-offs:

- **Per-project (default).** The skill runs the helper for the
  current project only. Future projects on this host need the
  skill re-run in each, OR the operator can pick whole-user later.
  No global git config changes.
- **Whole-user.** The skill walks the operator's existing local
  git checkouts and populates their `settings.local.json` files,
  then sets `git config --global core.hooksPath` so every future
  `git checkout` / `git clone` / `git worktree add` on the host
  picks up the framework's universal post-checkout hook.

**Prefer structured Q&A.** When the agent harness offers a
structured-question tool (e.g. Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`),
use a single-select prompt with `Per-project` as the default and
`Whole-user (with caveats)` as the alternative. Free-form chat is
the fallback.

If the user picks **per-project**, skip to *Step P.1 — Install
the helper script* and *Step P.2 — Run the helper for this project*,
then move on to the next step in the canonical install list.

If the user picks **whole-user**, follow Step P.0a's loud
disclosure first, then Step P.1, then Steps P.2-whole-user (walk
existing checkouts) and P.3-whole-user (install the global hook
+ set `core.hooksPath`).

##### Step P.0a — Loud disclosure before setting whole-user scope

If the operator picked whole-user, surface this disclosure
**before** any global config write. The operator must
acknowledge it explicitly; no silent proceed:

> **!!! WHOLE-USER SCOPE — `core.hooksPath` GLOBAL OVERRIDE !!!**
>
> Setting `git config --global core.hooksPath` makes git look up
> hooks in **one shared directory** for every repo on this host.
> Every `.git/hooks/*` in every existing repo on this machine
> becomes **inert** — git will no longer fire your per-repo
> `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`, or any other hook
> unless you migrate it into the shared dir.
>
> The framework installs **only** the `post-checkout` hook in the
> shared dir. If you rely on per-repo hooks today (formatters,
> linters, CI integration), you need to:
>
> - Either migrate them into `~/.claude/git-hooks/` so they fire
>   alongside the framework's `post-checkout`, **or**
> - Pick **per-project** scope instead and re-run this skill in
>   each project you adopt.
>
> Whole-user scope is reversible: `git config --global --unset core.hooksPath`
> restores per-repo hook lookup.

Confirm the operator wants to proceed with whole-user scope after
reading the disclosure. If they hesitate or pick per-project,
fall back to the per-project path.

#### Step P.1 — Install the helper script

(Both scopes.)

Copy `tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-add-project-root.sh` into
`~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh` (or symlink it
from `~/.claude-config/scripts/` if the operator uses the
private sync repo), mode `0755`. The script file lives
user-scope so a single install covers every adopter project on
the host; what it **writes** is project-local. The same install
mechanism the `sandbox-bypass-warn.sh` and `sandbox-status-line.sh`
helpers use (see the *Sandbox-bypass visibility hook* and
*Sandbox-state status line* sections of the doc).
#### Step P.2 — Run the helper for this project (per-project scope)

Skip if the operator picked whole-user scope (Step P.2-whole-user
below covers the equivalent).

Run the helper once with `--all-worktrees` in the adopter
repo's main checkout. The helper enumerates
`git worktree list --porcelain` and, for each worktree, writes
that worktree's absolute path into that worktree's own
`<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` (creating the file if
it does not yet exist). Idempotent, atomic, tolerant of missing
prereqs (see the script's header comment for the full
failure-mode list). On success, surface the diff so the operator
sees which entries landed; on no-op (paths already present),
surface a one-line "already covered" confirmation.

**Sandbox-bypass requirement when invoked from inside an agent
session.** `.claude/settings.local.json` is in Claude Code's
built-in sandbox `denyWithinAllow` set (verified empirically —
see
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Security rationale*](../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#security-rationale--why-project-local-is-safe-to-write-to)),
so the helper's Bash write is blocked when invoked through the
agent's `Bash` tool. If this skill is being walked from inside
a sandboxed session, invoke the helper with
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` and the reason
*"writing project-local sandbox-allowlist entries (issue #197 fix)"*.
The bypass triggers `sandbox-bypass-warn.sh`'s loud-red banner
so the operator sees and approves the single write. When the
operator runs `setup-isolated-setup-install` directly from a
terminal (the typical first-time-install path), no bypass is
needed — the script runs outside the agent sandbox.

#### Step P.2-whole-user — Walk existing checkouts (whole-user scope)

Skip if the operator picked per-project scope.

Walk the operator's existing git checkouts and populate each
one's `.claude/settings.local.json`. This pass is **settings-only**
by default — it does NOT install per-repo `post-checkout` hooks
(the global hook installed in Step P.3-whole-user covers that
for both existing and future repos via `core.hooksPath`).

1. **Prompt the operator for root directories to scan.**
   Default suggestions: `~/code/`, `~/projects/`, `~/dev/`,
   `~/work/`. Show the operator the list, let them edit it.
   Empty list → skip the walk; the operator can re-run this
   skill later when they want existing repos covered.

2. **Walk each root dir.** Use a depth-limited `find` with
   reasonable exclusions:

   ```bash
   find "<root>" -maxdepth 5 -type d -name .git \
       -not -path '*/node_modules/*' \
       -not -path '*/.venv/*' \
       -not -path '*/__pycache__/*' \
       -not -path '*/build/*' \
       -not -path '*/dist/*' \
       -not -path '*/.cache/*' \
       -prune
   ```

   For each `.git/` found, the parent dir is a working tree.
   De-duplicate by canonical path.

3. **For each working tree found, run the helper with
   `--all-worktrees`.** Same invocation as the per-project
   variant — the helper itself handles `git worktree list` so
   linked worktrees of the same repo get processed. The helper's
   built-in `git check-ignore` guard skips repos whose
   `.claude/settings.local.json` is not gitignored (defense in
   depth — the operator should fix the `.gitignore` first).

4. **Tabulate the result** for the operator: how many checkouts
   were scanned, how many had `.claude/` (so the helper wrote),
   how many were skipped (no `.claude/` directory, or
   `.claude/settings.local.json` not gitignored).

5. **Do not install per-repo `post-checkout` hooks** during this
   pass. The next sub-step covers future and existing repos
   uniformly via the global hook.

#### Step P.3-whole-user — Install the global post-checkout hook (whole-user scope)

Skip if the operator picked per-project scope.

1. **Install the universal `post-checkout` hook.** Copy
   `tools/agent-isolation/git-global-post-checkout.sh` into
   `~/.claude/git-hooks/post-checkout` (or symlink it from
   `~/.claude-config/git-hooks/post-checkout` if the operator
   uses the private sync repo), mode `0755`. The hook content is
   in
   [`tools/agent-isolation/git-global-post-checkout.sh`](../../../tools/agent-isolation/git-global-post-checkout.sh) —
   it calls the sandbox-allowlist helper and (for steward-adopted
   repos) `setup-steward verify --auto-fix-symlinks`.

2. **Set `core.hooksPath` globally** so every git operation across
   every repo on the host uses the shared hook dir:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.hooksPath "$HOME/.claude/git-hooks"
   ```

   Surface the resulting `git config --global --get core.hooksPath`
   value to the operator to confirm the write.

3. **Reiterate the implication** from Step P.0a's disclosure:
   per-repo `.git/hooks/*` are now inert across the entire host.
   The operator must migrate any per-repo hooks they want to keep.
   `git config --global --unset core.hooksPath` is the reversal.

After this step, future `git clone`, `git worktree add`, and
`git checkout` operations anywhere on the host invoke the
framework's universal post-checkout, which keeps each
Claude-Code-aware project's `.claude/settings.local.json` in
sync without any further operator action.

The `.` entry stays in the committed project-scope `allowRead`
regardless — the explicit absolute path in
`settings.local.json` is belt-and-braces, not a replacement. If
the harness ever stops resolving `.`, the explicit path still
covers the project; if `.` works correctly, the explicit entry is
redundant but harmless. The committed project-scope file is
**never** modified by the helper (machine-specific absolute paths
have no business in a file shared across contributors).

The helper is also invoked by `/setup-steward adopt`,
`/setup-steward upgrade`, and `/setup-steward worktree-init` for
the same reason. The `post-checkout` git hook installed by
`/setup-steward adopt` chains into the helper too, so new
worktrees added via `git worktree add` after this install pass
inherit access automatically — no operator action needed.

## After the install lands

Suggest two follow-up routines the user can wire later:

- `setup-isolated-setup-verify` — re-run after every Claude Code upgrade
  or settings-file edit, to confirm denials still fire as
  expected. The "did a denial silently turn into an allow?"
  signal is exactly what this skill exists for.
- `setup-isolated-setup-update` — periodic check for framework
  updates, pinned-tool upgrade candidates, and drift between the
  installed user-scope copies and the framework's
  source-of-truth. Recommend a per-Claude-Code-upgrade or
  monthly cadence, whichever comes first.

If the user has the `~/.claude-config` sync repo in place, also
mention `setup-shared-config-sync` for committing + pushing local
modifications to the shared scripts.
