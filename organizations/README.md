# Organizations

An **organization** in Magpie groups everything a governing body — a
foundation, a company, or an informal maintainer collective — makes
*default* for the projects that belong to it:

- its **identity** (`organization_identity`: `id`, full `name`, `url`,
  and `logo`) — the brand the website renders for projects under it;
- its **governance vocabulary** (what the governing body is called, how
  contributors are admitted, the project-lifecycle stages); and
- its **default backend selections + infrastructure values** — which
  tool [adapter](../docs/vendor-neutrality.md#tool-adapters) fulfils each
  capability (CVE authority, mail archive, project metadata, …) and the
  concrete URLs / addresses those backends use.

It is the layer between a single project's
[`<project-config>/`](../projects/_template/) and the framework
defaults. A project names its organization once
(`organization: <org>` in `<project-config>/project.md`) and inherits
the rest.

## Membership — what can belong to an organization

Beyond a *project*, four framework entities can declare that they
**belong to** an organization (and so assume its stack); the value names
a directory here, and absence means organization-agnostic:

| Entity | How it declares membership |
|---|---|
| **Skill** | `organization:` key in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter |
| **Skill family** | `organization:` scope banner in `docs/<family>/README.md` |
| **Tool** | `**Organization:** <org>` line in the tool `README.md` |
| **Tool adapter** | same as a tool — the adapter directory's README |

For example the ASF release-management and contributor-growth families,
their skills, and the `cve-tool-vulnogram` / `ponymail` /
`apache-projects` tools all declare `organization: ASF`. The validator
rejects a declared organization that has no directory here.

## Why this exists

Skills are vendor- and project-agnostic: they target *capabilities* and
resolve concrete values from configuration (see
[`docs/vendor-neutrality.md`](../docs/vendor-neutrality.md) and
[`PRINCIPLES.md` §12](../PRINCIPLES.md#12-the-framework-is-project-agnostic-concrete-names-live-in-adopter-config)).
Most of those concrete values are **the same for every project under one
organization** — every ASF project allocates CVEs through the same
Vulnogram instance, reads the same `lists.apache.org` archive, and gates
on PMC membership. Without this layer each project would re-declare the
identical "ASF defaults". The organization holds them once.

## Resolution order

Every placeholder and dotted config key resolves in this order
(first hit wins):

```text
<project-config>/project.md
  →  organizations/<org>/organization.md     (org named by project.md → organization:)
    →  framework default
```

A project overrides only what differs from its organization; an
organization overrides only what differs from the framework baseline.
The contract is stated once in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#configuration-resolution-order) — skills do
not branch on the organization.

## What ships here

| Organization | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`ASF/`](ASF/) | The **Apache Software Foundation** organization — the reference organization; the default values that reproduce ASF project behaviour. |
| [`independent/`](independent/) | The **no-formal-organization** baseline — DCO sign-off, GitHub-native security/releases, no mailing-list/forwarder/metadata backends. Used by [`projects/non-asf-example/`](../projects/non-asf-example/). |
| [`_template/`](_template/) | Authoring skeleton for a **new** organization. |

## Authoring a new organization

Copy [`_template/`](_template/) to fill in the governance vocabulary, the
capability→adapter bundle, and the identity (incl. `logo`), then point a
project at it with `organization: <org>`.

An organization can live in any of three homes (see
[`docs/extending.md`](../docs/extending.md) for the full model):

- **In-tree** — `organizations/<org>/` here, contributed to
  `apache/magpie` under Apache-2.0 so every project under the
  organization (and others) reuses it.
- **In your adopter repo** — `<project-config>/.apache-magpie-overrides/organizations/<org>/`,
  committed in the adopter repo when the organization is not (yet)
  in-tree.
- **In the organization's own repo** — maintained externally and vendored
  into the adopter's override location; discovery, never auto-fetch
  ([`PRINCIPLES.md` §13](../PRINCIPLES.md#13-snapshot-plus-override-never-vendored-copies)).

`organization: <org>` resolves in-tree first, then the adopter-local
copy. See
[`docs/adapters/authoring.md`](../docs/adapters/authoring.md) for the
authoring how-to.
