# Modes — MISSION taxonomy mapped to current skills

[`MISSION.md`](../MISSION.md) frames the framework around five
toggleable **modes** of agent-assisted repository maintainership
and development: **Agentic Triage**, **Agentic Mentoring**, **Agentic Drafting**
(agent-authored fixes with human review), **Agentic Pairing**
(developer-side dev-cycle skills with mentorship intrinsic), and
**Agentic Autonomous** (limited fix-and-merge). Each adopting
project picks the modes that match its culture and risk
tolerance.

This document maps that taxonomy to the skills that currently
ship in the framework. It is the **honest snapshot** — modes
that are not yet implemented are listed as such, with a tracking
issue or roadmap pointer rather than a placeholder shell. Read
[`MISSION.md`](../MISSION.md) for the *why* of each mode and the
sequencing commitments behind them.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **stable** | Implemented, in use by at least one adopter, behaviour expected to remain backward-compatible across minor framework versions. |
| **experimental** | Implemented but not yet covered by an adopter pilot or contributor-sentiment evaluation; shape may change. |
| **proposed** | Designed in [`MISSION.md`](../MISSION.md) but no skill yet exists; tracked for future implementation. |
| **off** | Deliberately not implemented per a MISSION-level sequencing rule (Agentic Autonomous). |

## Modes at a glance

The **Mode** column below holds the canonical identifier used in each skill's
`mode:` frontmatter (and validated against this table). The display name carried
in the docs and on the site prefixes it with *Agentic* — *Agentic Triage*,
*Agentic Mentoring*, *Agentic Drafting*, *Agentic Pairing*, and *Agentic
Autonomous* (the renamed former *Auto-merge*).

| Mode | Purpose | Status | Skill count |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Triage** | *(Agentic Triage)* Issues, security reports, PRs: spot, classify, route, surface duplicates. Every output is a suggestion the human signs off on. | stable (security) / experimental (pr-management, issue-management, contributor-nomination, repo-health, release-management) | 32 |
| **Mentoring** | *(Agentic Mentoring)* Joins issue and PR threads in a teaching register: clarifying questions, pointers to project conventions, paired examples from prior PRs, hand-off to a human when scope exceeds the agent. Also authors net-new good first issues, curates the existing backlog, and explains filed issues to newcomers to lower onboarding latency. | experimental | 7 |
| **Drafting** | *(Agentic Drafting)* Agent drafts a fix for a well-scoped problem and opens a PR; every PR is reviewed and merged by a human committer. | stable (security-only); experimental (issue-management, audit-findings, release-management family) | 9 |
| **Pairing** | *(Agentic Pairing)* Developer-side dev-cycle skills with mentorship intrinsic — multi-agent review pipelines, self-review and pre-flight patterns, scoped fix drafting under the developer's driver's seat. | experimental | 2 |
| **Agentic Autonomous** | Auto-merge restricted to objectively boring change classes only (lint, dependency bumps inside an allow-list, license-header insertion, formatting, broken-link repair). | off | 0 |

A few skills sit **outside** the mode taxonomy by design — see
[Outside the modes](#outside-the-modes) below.

## Triage

Inbound report and PR triage. The lowest-risk surface and the
foundation everything else builds on. Skills propose labels,
spot duplicates, link related discussions, classify reports
against prior triaged cases, and route to the right human; they
do not act without human review.

| Skill | Domain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`pr-management-triage`](../skills/pr-management-triage/SKILL.md) | Generic PR queue triage. | experimental |
| [`pr-management-stats`](../skills/pr-management-stats/SKILL.md) | PR-queue reporting (supports triage decisions). | experimental |
| [`pr-management-code-review`](../skills/pr-management-code-review/SKILL.md) | Maintainer-facing deep code review. | experimental |
| [`reviewer-routing`](../skills/reviewer-routing/SKILL.md) | Suggest a primary reviewer and optional backup for an open issue or PR from the configured roster, touched areas, git-history familiarity, and current review load; waits for maintainer confirmation before any assignment or review request. | experimental |
| [`issue-triage`](../skills/issue-triage/SKILL.md) | General-issue-tracker triage (per-issue classification + disposition proposal). | experimental |
| [`issue-reassess`](../skills/issue-reassess/SKILL.md) | Pool-level sweep of resolved / EOL issues for re-assessment. | experimental |
| [`issue-stale-sweep`](../skills/issue-stale-sweep/SKILL.md) | Sweep open issues for inactivity past a configurable threshold; proposes a nudge (`REQUEST-UPDATE`) or a pre-close notice (`CLOSE-STALE`); waits for maintainer confirmation before posting. | experimental |
| [`issue-backlog-stats`](../skills/issue-backlog-stats/SKILL.md) | Read-only maintainer dashboard for the open general-issue backlog: health rating, age/staleness breakdowns, area pressure ranking, and triage-funnel summary. | experimental |
| [`issue-deduplicate`](../skills/issue-deduplicate/SKILL.md) | Merge two open `<issue-tracker>` issues that describe the same root cause, preserving both reporters' context; proposes closure comment on the duplicate and a cross-reference on the kept issue. | experimental |
| [`contributor-nomination`](../skills/contributor-nomination/SKILL.md) | Nomination-readiness brief for a named contributor — activity breadth, consistency, and evidence prose for a committer or PMC thread. | experimental |
| [`security-issue-import`](../skills/security-issue-import/SKILL.md) | Inbound security-report classification + initial routing. | stable |
| [`security-issue-import-from-pr`](../skills/security-issue-import-from-pr/SKILL.md) | Open a tracker from a security-relevant public PR. | stable |
| [`security-issue-import-from-md`](../skills/security-issue-import-from-md/SKILL.md) | Bulk-import findings from a markdown report. | stable |
| [`security-issue-deduplicate`](../skills/security-issue-deduplicate/SKILL.md) | Merge two trackers describing the same root-cause vulnerability. | stable |
| [`security-issue-invalidate`](../skills/security-issue-invalidate/SKILL.md) | Close a tracker as invalid with a polite-but-firm reporter reply. | stable |
| [`security-issue-sync`](../skills/security-issue-sync/SKILL.md) | Reconcile a tracker against its mail thread, fix PR, release train, and archives. | stable |
| [`security-cve-allocate`](../skills/security-cve-allocate/SKILL.md) | Allocate a CVE for a tracker (Vulnogram URL + paste-ready JSON). | stable |
| [`security-issue-triage`](../skills/security-issue-triage/SKILL.md) | Batch-triage open tracker issues carrying `needs triage`; classifies each into one of six dispositions and posts a proposal comment on confirmation. | experimental |
| [`security-issue-import-via-forwarder`](../skills/security-issue-import-via-forwarder/SKILL.md) | Sub-skill of `security-issue-import` / `-invalidate` / `-sync` for the relay/forwarder case: reports relayed by an upstream broker (e.g. ASF security team) rather than arriving directly from the reporter. | experimental |
| [`security-issue-import-from-scan`](../skills/security-issue-import-from-scan/SKILL.md) | Triage a security scanner's multi-finding output (via the `scan-format` adapter) into per-finding dispositions; opens tracker issues only after operator confirmation of the triage decisions. | experimental |
| [`contributor-activity-sweep`](../skills/contributor-activity-sweep/SKILL.md) | Read-only GitHub activity card for a named contributor: PR authorship, code-review participation, issues, and comments over a configurable window. | experimental |
| [`contributor-sentiment`](../skills/contributor-sentiment/SKILL.md) | Measures contributor-sentiment signals (thread tone, time-to-first-reply, first-PR retention, reviewer load) and produces the structured gate report for experimental→stable advancement. | experimental |
| [`pr-management-quick-merge`](../skills/pr-management-quick-merge/SKILL.md) | Identify trivial, low-risk PRs in the `ready for maintainer review` queue that pass every quality gate and touch only supplementary areas (docs, changelog, translations, tests); surfaces candidates with diff summaries and the exact merge command. | experimental |
| [`ci-runner-audit`](../skills/ci-runner-audit/SKILL.md) | Read-only audit of GitHub Actions workflow runner compatibility across one repo, an explicit set, one Apache project's repos, or the full Apache GitHub org. | experimental |
| [`dependency-audit`](../skills/dependency-audit/SKILL.md) | Read-only dependency vulnerability audit: detects the project's dependency manager(s), runs the appropriate audit tool, surfaces patchable findings grouped by severity, and proposes upgrades for maintainer review. | experimental |
| [`workflow-security-audit`](../skills/workflow-security-audit/SKILL.md) | Read-only GitHub Actions workflow security audit powered by `zizmor`: surfaces injection vulnerabilities, excessive permissions, unpinned external actions, and self-hosted-runner fork-secret leaks. | experimental |
| [`license-compliance-audit`](../skills/license-compliance-audit/SKILL.md) | Read-only license-compliance audit: LICENSE presence, NOTICE completeness when required, and SPDX-header consistency across source files; proposes remedies for maintainer review. | experimental |
| [`flaky-test-triage`](../skills/flaky-test-triage/SKILL.md) | Read-only flaky-test detection from CI run history: per-job failure-rate analysis over a configurable window, separating intermittent (flaky) from deterministic failures. | experimental |
| [`release-verify-rc`](../skills/release-verify-rc/SKILL.md) | Read-only pre-flight on a staged RC: signatures against project KEYS, checksums, license headers (Apache RAT), NOTICE/LICENSE diff, no prohibited binaries, version-string consistency. Doubles as an Agentic Pairing-mode skill voters run in their own dev loop. | experimental |
| [`release-vote-tally`](../skills/release-vote-tally/SKILL.md) | Fetch the approval signal for an RC, classify each reply (+1 / 0 / -1) binding vs non-binding against the configured roster, produce the tally summary, and draft the `[RESULT] [VOTE]` email. Conservative on ambiguous votes, refuses to count. | experimental |
| [`release-archive-sweep`](../skills/release-archive-sweep/SKILL.md) | Scan `dist/release/<project>/`, identify releases past retention, propose the `svn mv` sequence to `archive.apache.org`. | experimental |
| [`release-audit-report`](../skills/release-audit-report/SKILL.md) | Per-release structured report (RM, voters with binding flags, artefacts with sigs and checksums, promote revision, `[ANNOUNCE]` archive URL) appended to the project's audit log. | experimental |

Three notes on the boundaries:

- `pr-management-code-review` is a deeper variant of triage —
  the agent reads diff and surrounding code rather than only
  metadata, but the output is still a suggestion for the human
  reviewer. It belongs to Agentic Triage by the same rule.
- `security-cve-allocate` is procedural rather than classificatory
  (CVE allocation happens after assessment), but it shares Agentic Triage's
  shape: the agent prepares a paste-ready artefact, the human
  PMC member submits it. Listed here for navigability.
- The four `release-*` Agentic Triage skills share the same paste-ready-
  artefact shape: `release-verify-rc` reports pass/fail per check,
  `release-vote-tally` proposes `[RESULT]`, `release-archive-sweep`
  proposes an `svn mv` sequence, `release-audit-report` proposes
  an audit-log append. None of them flip state labels or
  publish artefacts, see
  [`docs/release-management/spec.md` § Cross-cutting commitments](release-management/spec.md#cross-cutting-commitments).

## Mentoring

**Status: experimental. 7 skills shipped.**

[`MISSION.md` § Agentic Mentoring](../MISSION.md#technical-scope) names this
the highest-value project-side mode and the one off-the-shelf agent
tooling skips. The spec — tone guide, hand-off protocol, adopter
contract — landed ahead of the skill code so the project's tone
choices were reviewable independently from the runtime behaviour.

| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`pr-management-mentor`](../skills/pr-management-mentor/SKILL.md) | Draft a teaching-register comment on a single GitHub issue or PR thread; waits for maintainer confirmation before posting. | experimental |
| [`good-first-issue-author`](../skills/good-first-issue-author/SKILL.md) | Draft one net-new good first issue from a supplied gap or small task (suitability gate + readiness checklist); waits for maintainer confirmation before filing. | experimental |
| [`mentoring-welcome`](../skills/mentoring-welcome/SKILL.md) | Draft a first-contact orientation comment for a first-time contributor on a newly opened issue or PR; detects first-time authorship via `author_association`, drafts a welcome with contributing-guide link and expected next steps; waits for maintainer confirmation before posting. | experimental |
| [`contributor-to-committer`](../skills/contributor-to-committer/SKILL.md) | Read-only readiness tracker mapping a contributor's GitHub activity against the adopter's PMC-declared committer/PMC thresholds; surfaces a traffic-light brief (Not yet / Approaching / Ready to nominate) plus the specific evidence gaps that remain. | experimental |
| [`good-first-issue-sweep`](../skills/good-first-issue-sweep/SKILL.md) | Sweep the open issue backlog for existing issues that could be labelled as good first issues; scores each against the G1–G7 suitability rubric and classifies as READY / NEAR-MISS / SKIP; proposes labels only after explicit maintainer confirmation. | experimental |
| [`onboarding-concierge`](../skills/onboarding-concierge/SKILL.md) | Answer a newcomer's "how do I contribute here" question by grounding the response in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the project's own docs; classifies the question (setup / workflow / first-issue), retrieves the relevant excerpt, and drafts a concise answer; hands off to a human for design, security, or out-of-scope questions. | experimental |
| [`newcomer-issue-explainer`](../skills/newcomer-issue-explainer/SKILL.md) | Given an open good-first-issue, explain it in beginner terms and sketch a concrete approach (file pointers, done-definition, where to ask); assessment gate declines closed, security-sensitive, or scope-unclear issues; nothing is posted without maintainer confirmation. | experimental |

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`docs/mentoring/README.md`](mentoring/README.md) | Family overview, current status, planned shape. |
| [`docs/mentoring/spec.md`](mentoring/spec.md) | Full spec: scope, triggers, register, hand-off, adopter knobs. |
| [`projects/_template/mentoring-config.md`](../projects/_template/mentoring-config.md) | Adopter-config scaffold (required before running the skill). |

The prototype ships flagged `mode: Mentoring` + `experimental`. Shape
may change as adopter pilots and contributor-sentiment evaluation land.
The skill is read-only by default and never posts without explicit
maintainer confirmation — see
[`pr-management-mentor/SKILL.md`](../skills/pr-management-mentor/SKILL.md)
for the full contract.

The closest existing surface is
[`pr-management-triage/comment-templates.md`](../skills/pr-management-triage/comment-templates.md),
which carries Agentic Triage classification responses — informational,
not pedagogical. It is **not** Agentic Mentoring.

## Drafting

The agent drafts a fix for a well-scoped problem (a tracked
issue, a triaged security report with team consensus on scope, a
failing test with an obvious cause, a documentation hole) and
opens a PR. Every PR is reviewed and merged by a human committer;
the agent never merges its own work.

| Skill | Domain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`security-issue-fix`](../skills/security-issue-fix/SKILL.md) | Draft a fix PR in `<upstream>` from a triaged, CVE-allocated tracker. | stable (security-only) |
| [`issue-fix-workflow`](../skills/issue-fix-workflow/SKILL.md) | Draft a fix for a triaged general-issue-tracker issue (BUG or FEATURE-REQUEST). | experimental |
| [`audit-finding-fix`](../skills/audit-finding-fix/SKILL.md) | Draft fixes for non-security audit-tool findings (lint violations, type errors, CodeQL alerts, doc-coverage gaps); re-runs the tool after each batch to confirm findings are cleared. | experimental |
| [`release-prepare`](../skills/release-prepare/SKILL.md) | Planning issue + version-bump / changelog / NOTICE / LICENSE prep PR (Steps 1-2). Also the post-release `-SNAPSHOT` bump (Step 14). | experimental |
| [`release-keys-sync`](../skills/release-keys-sync/SKILL.md) | Draft the `KEYS` diff for a new Release Manager (Step 3). Agent never holds the private key. | experimental |
| [`release-rc-cut`](../skills/release-rc-cut/SKILL.md) | Paste-ready command sequence: signed tag, build, detached signatures, checksums, `svn import` to `dist/dev/` (Steps 4-5). Agent never signs and never imports. | experimental |
| [`release-vote-draft`](../skills/release-vote-draft/SKILL.md) | Draft the `[VOTE]` email body to `dev@<project>` (Step 7). Agent never sends. | experimental |
| [`release-promote`](../skills/release-promote/SKILL.md) | Emit the backend-shaped promotion command set for a release that has passed its vote; proposes the `promoted` label. Agent never runs the promotion command and never publishes the release. | experimental |
| [`release-announce-draft`](../skills/release-announce-draft/SKILL.md) | Draft the `[ANNOUNCE]` email body for `announce@apache.org` and the site-bump PR (Step 11). Agent never sends mail and never merges the PR. | experimental |

[`audit-finding-fix`](../skills/audit-finding-fix/SKILL.md)
extends Agentic Drafting to **non-security audit-tool findings**: lint
violations, type errors, CodeQL alerts, and documentation-coverage
gaps. It is the generic-Agentic Drafting companion to
[`issue-fix-workflow`](../skills/issue-fix-workflow/SKILL.md)
(issue-tracker bugs) and
[`security-issue-fix`](../skills/security-issue-fix/SKILL.md)
(security-class findings). Failing tests with an obvious cause
remain proposed.

The `release-*` skills form a single family
([`docs/release-management/README.md`](release-management/README.md))
spanning Agentic Drafting (Steps 1–5, 7, 10–11, 14) and Agentic Triage (Steps 6, 9,
12–13). All ten have now shipped `experimental`. They share the
security family's discipline that every state-changing action is a
*proposal* the human executes — see
[`docs/release-management/spec.md` § Cross-cutting commitments](release-management/spec.md#cross-cutting-commitments).

For security-class Agentic Drafting PRs, the public surface strips CVE
and private context per the project's disclosure policy, so the
public surface stays clean until the embargo lifts — see
[`AGENTS.md` § Confidentiality](../AGENTS.md#confidentiality-of-the-tracker-repository)
for the rules the skill enforces.

## Pairing

**Status: experimental. 2 skills.**

[`MISSION.md` § Agentic Pairing](../MISSION.md#technical-scope) introduces
this mode as the developer-side counterpart to the project-side
modes. Where Agentic Triage / Agentic Mentoring / Agentic Drafting / Agentic Autonomous describe
the agent's presence on the project's own infrastructure, Agentic Pairing
skills run in the maintainer's or contributor's *own* dev loop —
multi-agent review pipelines, self-review and pre-flight patterns,
scoped fix drafting under the developer's driver's seat.
**Mentorship is intrinsic** to Agentic Pairing skills: the agent handles
the mechanical, implementation-detail review (formatting,
conventions, lint-grade nits) so the human conversation between
contributor and maintainer — and between peer maintainers —
stays on design, reasoning, and the trade-offs the project cares
about. Agentic Pairing skills are the platform's mechanism for protecting
the **ASF contribution path** (contributor → committer → PMC)
against being eroded by automation that replaces, rather than
augments, the human-to-human relationships that path is built on.

Agentic Pairing skills don't make state changes on behalf of the project;
they share the same skill format and security posture as the
project-side modes, so a maintainer who already trusts the
framework for Agentic Triage gets the same posture for the patches they
write themselves.

| Skill | Domain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`pairing-self-review`](../skills/pairing-self-review/SKILL.md) | Pre-flight self-review of local changes before opening a PR. Read-only; returns a structured report. | experimental |
| [`pairing-multi-agent-review`](../skills/pairing-multi-agent-review/SKILL.md) | Fan a diff through three independent review passes (correctness, security, conventions) and merge findings. | experimental |

**Sequencing.** Agentic Pairing ships before Agentic Autonomous in the project's
automation roadmap — full auto-merge of maintainer-driven changes
follows only after Agentic Pairing has established that human reasoning
and relationships, not implementation chatter, are the
load-bearing parts of the workflow.

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`docs/pairing/README.md`](pairing/README.md) | Family overview: skills, when to use each, adopter contract. |

## Agentic Autonomous

**Status: off. Deliberately not implemented.**

[`MISSION.md` § Agentic Autonomous](../MISSION.md#technical-scope) holds
auto-merge off until Agentic Triage, Agentic Mentoring, Agentic Drafting, and Agentic Pairing
have been running for two quarters and contributor-sentiment
data says the project is healthier, not just faster.
Security-class changes are explicitly **out** of Agentic Autonomous — no
auto-merge ever touches anything embargoed or CVE-tagged.

The framework's current `.asf.yaml` configuration reflects this
posture: `pull_requests.allow_auto_merge` is set to `false`
([`.asf.yaml`](../.asf.yaml)).

When Agentic Autonomous ships, the eligible change classes will be
declared per-adopter in `<project-config>/` and gated by an
allow-list that the framework refuses to grow without an
adopter PR.

## Outside the modes

Several skills are framework infrastructure rather than
maintainership modes. They support adoption, isolation, and
upgrade flows; they do not act on issues, PRs, or contributor
threads on their own.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`setup`](../skills/setup/SKILL.md) | Adopt the framework into an adopter repo; manage the snapshot, symlinks, and overrides. |
| [`issue-reproducer`](../skills/issue-reproducer/SKILL.md) | Per-issue code extraction + execution; produces structured evidence. Read-only on the tracker. |
| [`issue-reassess-stats`](../skills/issue-reassess-stats/SKILL.md) | Read-only dashboard over reassessment-campaign verdict.json files. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-install`](../skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md) | Install the credential-isolation sandbox harness. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-update`](../skills/setup-isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md) | Update pinned system tools (`bubblewrap`, `socat`, agent CLI) past the cooldown window. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-verify`](../skills/setup-isolated-setup-verify/SKILL.md) | Read-only health check of the sandbox harness. |
| [`setup-override-upstream`](../skills/setup-override-upstream/SKILL.md) | Promote an adopter's local override into a framework PR. |
| [`setup-shared-config-sync`](../skills/setup-shared-config-sync/SKILL.md) | Sync shared configuration across worktrees. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-doctor`](../skills/setup-isolated-setup-doctor/SKILL.md) | In-session functional health check of the secure-agent sandbox: probes SSH agent / Yubikey reachability, localhost port access, and filesystem restrictions. |
| [`setup-status`](../skills/setup-status/SKILL.md) | Render a Markdown adoption dashboard: install method and pin, drift, and which skills are wired in the current repo. |
| [`committer-onboarding`](../skills/committer-onboarding/SKILL.md) | Post-vote committer and PMC onboarding for Apache projects: walks the nominator through every step from ICLA check to welcome announcement for both podlings and TLPs. |
| [`security-tracker-stats-dashboard`](../skills/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/SKILL.md) | Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard of `<tracker>` statistics (lifecycle-band breakdowns, time-to-triage trends, velocity) without modifying any tracker state. |
| [`optimize-skill`](../skills/optimize-skill/SKILL.md) | Optimize an existing framework skill by applying restructuring patterns: split oversized SKILL.md into linked sibling docs, trim frontmatter, improve eval alignment. |
| [`list-skills`](../skills/list-skills/SKILL.md) | Print a live index of every skill in this repository grouped by family, with each skill's name and first-sentence description. |
| [`write-skill`](../skills/write-skill/SKILL.md) | Author a new framework skill or update an existing one: frontmatter, placeholder convention, injection defences, Privacy-LLM gate-check, and validator sign-off. |

The `setup*` skills ship as a single **setup family** — see
[`docs/setup/README.md`](setup/README.md). The remaining skills
(`committer-onboarding`, `security-tracker-stats-dashboard`,
`optimize-skill`, `list-skills`, `write-skill`) are standalone
framework utilities.

## Mode lifecycle

A mode moves through four states as it matures:

1. **proposed** — designed in [`MISSION.md`](../MISSION.md), no
   skill code yet. Spec PRs may land before any skill code so
   tone, scope, and adopter knobs are reviewable in isolation.
2. **experimental** — at least one skill exists, behaviour may
   change, no adopter pilot has run an evaluation. Adopters
   can opt-in but should expect breaking changes between
   framework versions.
3. **stable** — at least one adopter is running the mode in
   production, behaviour is backward-compatible across minor
   framework versions. The default state for skills shipped to
   adopters.
4. **graduated-to-Agentic-Autonomous-eligible** *(future state; Agentic Triage,
   Agentic Mentoring, Agentic Drafting, and Agentic Pairing only)* — the mode has run
   stable for two quarters with positive contributor-sentiment
   evidence, the framework will start considering an equivalent
   change class for Agentic Autonomous. This state does not exist yet
   because Agentic Autonomous itself is off.

A mode can be **retracted** from any state. The retraction
triggers MISSION names — sustained negative contributor
sentiment, a confidentiality leak, a sandbox bypass that escapes
detection — apply per-adopter and per-mode. A retraction in one
adopter does not auto-retract in another, but the framework
records it for cross-adopter pattern detection.
