# Apache Training module: Building and running AI agents for open-source projects

This directory packages the [maintainer-education stream](../README.md) as a
reusable, LMS-neutral **Apache Training module**. Any project — ASF or not —
can use it to *teach* the material in a structured course, not just circulate
the pages as reading. It is shaped for upstream contribution to
[Apache Training](https://training.apache.org/) so the module can live there
once it is stable.

## Who this is for

Instructors and facilitators running the education stream as a course:
workshops, on-boarding sessions, reading groups, self-paced curricula, or any
environment where learners need per-lesson structure (objectives, exercises,
assessment) in addition to the reference pages.

Learners using the module self-paced do not need an LMS. Every lesson is a
plain Markdown file: read it, work through the exercises, and answer the
self-check questions before moving on.

## Relationship to the source pages

Each lesson in this module is a **wrapper** around one or more
[progression pages](../README.md). The source pages are the canonical
reference; the lessons add LMS-friendly structure on top:

- **Learning objectives** — what a learner will be able to *do* after the
  lesson, written as observable, assessable outcomes.
- **Exercises** — hands-on activities a learner can complete without access
  to a live system (paper/whiteboard activities use the page's own examples).
- **Self-check** — short questions (and answers) the learner uses to gate
  themselves before moving to the next lesson.

Nothing in this directory duplicates the reference material; it only frames it.

## Delivery formats

**Self-paced.** Learners read the source page, then work through the lesson
wrapper (objectives, exercises, self-check) on their own. No instructor or LMS
needed.

**Instructor-led.** An instructor presents the key ideas from the source page,
assigns the exercises to pairs or small groups, and uses the self-check
questions for a brief group debrief before moving on. The facilitator guide
(planned, not yet shipped) covers room setup, timing, and group discussion
prompts.

**LMS upload.** Each lesson is a Markdown file that can be converted to SCORM,
xAPI, or any other format a specific LMS supports. The module does not assume
any particular LMS. Learning time estimates above are rough guides for LMS
credit-hour tagging.

## Prerequisites

No prior AI experience. Learners should be comfortable reading and writing
plain text, and familiar with the idea of a software project that uses version
control. Specific technical prerequisites are stated in each lesson.

## Placeholders

Exercises use `<PROJECT>` wherever a real project name would appear.
Substitute your own project name when working through the activities.

## Licence
