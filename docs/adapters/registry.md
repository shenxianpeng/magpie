# Adapter registry

A **discovery** index of the [tool adapters](../vendor-neutrality.md#tool-adapters)
and [organizations](../../organizations/README.md) Magpie knows about —
the ones that ship in-tree, the open extension points, and links to
**community-maintained adapters defined elsewhere**.

> **Discovery, never installation.** Per
> [`PRINCIPLES.md` §13](../../PRINCIPLES.md#13-snapshot-plus-override-never-vendored-copies),
> this page is an index, not a package manager. Nothing here is
> auto-fetched. To use an adapter you wire it in deliberately — point
> your `<project-config>/project.md` (or `organizations/<org>/`) at it,
> exactly as you would a built-in one. An external link is a pointer for
> humans to evaluate, not a supply-chain hook.

To author a new adapter, see [`authoring.md`](authoring.md).

## In-tree tool adapters

Each capability contract under `tools/<contract>/` enumerates the
adapters that fulfil it. Shipping = a working adapter in the tree;
extension point = a documented, labelled slot with a tracking issue.

| Capability contract | Shipping adapter(s) | Extension points (tracked) |
|---|---|---|
| [`tools/cve-tool`](../../tools/cve-tool/) | [`cve-tool-vulnogram`](../../tools/cve-tool-vulnogram/) (ASF) | MITRE form, CVE.org direct, GHSA |

## Community / external adapters

Adapters maintained **outside** this repository — kept in their authors'
own repos and linked here for discovery. An adopter wires one in by
pointing their config at it (see the discovery-not-installation note
above); the framework never fetches them.

| Adapter | Capability / org | Maintainer | Link | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(none listed yet)* | | | | Open a PR to add a row — see below. |

### Adding an external adapter to this index

Open a PR against `apache/magpie` that adds one row to the table above
with: the adapter name, the capability contract (or organization) it
implements, the maintainer, a link to its repository, and a one-line
note. Listing here is **editorial discovery only** — it makes no
guarantee about the adapter and triggers no install. Adapters you would
rather contribute into the tree itself follow [`authoring.md`](authoring.md)
instead.
