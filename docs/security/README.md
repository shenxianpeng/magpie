# Security workflow skill family

> **Scope.** Works on any project, ASF or not. The ASF intake
> path (`security@`, Vulnogram CVE flow) is the default profile; non-ASF
> adopters swap it for GitHub Security Advisories / a MITRE CNA through the
> adapter/config layer.

End-to-end automation for an ASF project's security-issue handling
process — from inbound report on the project's `security@` mailing
list through to a published CVE record on `cve.org`. Eleven skills
that compose into the canonical 16-step lifecycle, plus one read-only
supporting skill for tracker-stats dashboards (twelve skills total).

Why a framework skill family? The 16-step process exists across
the foundation; every project's security team runs essentially
the same workflow with project-specific scope labels, mailing-list
addresses, milestone formats, and canned-response wording. Lifting
the workflow into a project-agnostic framework lets each adopter
plug their specifics into [`<project-config>/`](../../projects/_template/)
and reuse the skills verbatim.

## Skills

### Lifecycle skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`security-issue-import`](../../skills/security-issue-import/SKILL.md) | Import new reports from `<security-list>` into `<tracker>`. |
| [`security-issue-import-from-pr`](../../skills/security-issue-import-from-pr/SKILL.md) | Open a tracker for a security-relevant fix opened as a public PR. |
| [`security-issue-import-from-md`](../../skills/security-issue-import-from-md/SKILL.md) | Bulk-import findings from a markdown report. |
| [`security-issue-import-from-scan`](../../skills/security-issue-import-from-scan/SKILL.md) | Import findings from a security scanner output (Trivy, Grype, etc.) into `<tracker>`. |
| [`security-issue-import-via-forwarder`](../../skills/security-issue-import-via-forwarder/SKILL.md) | Import reports relayed through the ASF security forwarder when no direct reporter contact exists. |
| [`security-issue-triage`](../../skills/security-issue-triage/SKILL.md) | Propose an initial-triage disposition (VALID / DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH / INFO-ONLY / INVALID / PROBABLE-DUP / FIX-ALREADY-PUBLIC) for each tracker still in `Needs triage`; opens a discussion comment, never flips the label. |
| [`security-issue-sync`](../../skills/security-issue-sync/SKILL.md) | Reconcile a tracker against its mail thread, fix PR, release train, and archives. |
| [`security-cve-allocate`](../../skills/security-cve-allocate/SKILL.md) | Allocate a CVE for a tracker (Vulnogram URL + paste-ready JSON). |
| [`security-issue-fix`](../../skills/security-issue-fix/SKILL.md) | Implement the fix as a public PR in `<upstream>`. |
| [`security-issue-deduplicate`](../../skills/security-issue-deduplicate/SKILL.md) | Merge two trackers describing the same root-cause vulnerability. |
| [`security-issue-invalidate`](../../skills/security-issue-invalidate/SKILL.md) | Close a tracker as invalid with a polite-but-firm reporter reply. |

### Supporting tools

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`security-tracker-stats-dashboard`](../../skills/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/SKILL.md) | Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard of `<tracker>` repo statistics (lifecycle bands, opened-vs-untriaged backlog, mean time to triage / first response / fix). Read-only — never modifies tracker state. |

## Deep documentation

- [**`process.md`**](process.md) — the 16-step lifecycle with
  Mermaid diagram + per-step description; the label lifecycle
  state diagram + label reference table. The authoritative
  process reference.
- [**`roles.md`**](roles.md) — who owns which steps (issue
  triager / remediation developer / release manager), the shared
  conventions every role observes (keeping the reporter informed,
  recording status transitions, confidentiality), and the
  role-by-role workflow walkthroughs.
- [**`how-to-fix-a-security-issue.md`**](how-to-fix-a-security-issue.md) —
  hands-on guide for a remediation developer picking up a
  CVE-allocated tracker and shipping the fix.
- [**`new-members-onboarding.md`**](new-members-onboarding.md) —
  onboarding for a new security-team member: tracker access, mail
  list subscription, expected reading, first triage shadow.
- [**`threat-model.md`**](threat-model.md) — release-blocking
  threat model for the security skill family: trust boundaries,
  adversary personas, STRIDE matrix per skill, mitigation cross-
  reference, residual risk, and the re-audit cadence.
- [**`forwarder-routing-policy.md`**](forwarder-routing-policy.md) —
  when a tracker has no direct reporter contact (ASF-relay,
  read-only GHSA, anonymous tip), the skills route reporter-facing
  communication through the forwarder. The policy defines when
  that mode applies, the milestone list (events that **do** get
  relayed), and the negative list (events that don't — including
  credit-confirmation questions and regular workflow status).

## Adopter contract

The skills resolve project-specific content from the security-
workflow files in
[`<project-config>/`](../../projects/_template/) — see the
adopter scaffold's
[`README.md`](../../projects/_template/README.md) for the
file-by-file index. Required at minimum:

- `project.md` — identity, repos, mailing lists, tools
- `canned-responses.md` — reporter-facing reply templates
- `scope-labels.md` — scope label → CVE product mapping
- `release-trains.md` — release-manager attribution
- `title-normalization.md` — CVE-title regex cascade

Optional but commonly needed:
`milestones.md`, `fix-workflow.md`, `security-model.md`,
`naming-conventions.md`.
