     OAuth-pushed variant of the release-manager hand-off comment
     posted by `security-issue-sync` at the `pr merged` → `fix released`
     transition (Step 12 of the lifecycle), when the operator's machine
     had a valid Vulnogram OAuth session at sync time **and** the
     `vulnogram-api-record-update` push of the regenerated CVE JSON
     succeeded.

     This template is the counterpart to `release-manager-handoff-
     comment.md` (the manual-paste variant). The sync skill picks
     between the two based on the outcome of `vulnogram-api-check` +
     `vulnogram-api-record-update` — see Step 5b of
     `.claude/skills/security-issue-sync/SKILL.md` for the decision
     flow.

     **Gate**: this comment is ONLY posted when the CVE record's
     state in Vulnogram is `REVIEW` (verified by sync via
     `vulnogram-api-record-fetch` after Step 5b's push attempt).
     When the record is still `DRAFT` after the push attempt — for
     any reason — sync posts the
     `remediation-developer-fill-fields-comment.md` instead and the
     tracker stays assigned to the remediation developer. The RM
     never receives a hand-off while the record is in `DRAFT`.

     Idempotency: the marker on the first line is the **same** as
     the manual-paste variant's. The skill's idempotency grep keys
     on the marker only; the variant choice is detected by
     re-reading the comment body and checking which template's
     signature it carries. On a re-sync where the previous comment
     is the manual-paste variant but the current push succeeded,
     the skill PATCH-edits the comment body in place to the
     OAuth-pushed body (no second comment).

     The OAuth-pushed variant intentionally carries **no `uv run`
     invocations as RM-facing instructions** — the API push (and any
     re-push triggered by a body change) is run by
     `security-issue-sync` during sync, not by the release manager.
     The RM's surface is restricted to Vulnogram UI clicks,
     reviewer-thread responses, and the advisory send.

## 🚀 Release-manager hand-off — [`CVE_ID`](SOURCE_TAB_URL)  *(CVE JSON auto-pushed)*

RM_HANDLE — the release with the fix has shipped, and the CVE record on Vulnogram is in **`REVIEW`** state with all mandatory content populated. The security team's last sync auto-pushed the CVE JSON over the OAuth API at `PUSH_TIMESTAMP` and the record state advanced to `REVIEW`, which is the precondition for this hand-off.

This tracker is now yours to drive from **Steps 13 → 14 → 15** of the security process. Three actions, in order; each one is a single click in Vulnogram; **no shell commands required from you at any point**.

> **You will never see this comment while the record is in `DRAFT`.** Sync gates the hand-off on the record reaching `REVIEW`. If you ever see this comment paired with a `DRAFT` state on the linked record, please ping @potiuk on this issue before clicking anything in Vulnogram — that combination is a bug we want to know about, not a state for you to resolve.
>
> *(The security team has already pushed the CVE JSON content into Vulnogram and filled every body field on this tracker that the public advisory needs. Your job is to: address any CVE-reviewer feedback that lands during `REVIEW`, move the record to `READY` when review closes, then send the advisory email. That's it.)*

---

### Step 1 of 3 — address reviewer feedback (if any), then promote to READY

Open the record's [`#source` tab](SOURCE_TAB_URL) in your browser. **State** field at the top should read `REVIEW` — that is the precondition for this comment firing, so it should match. If it doesn't, stop and ping @potiuk; otherwise:

1. **Click the [`#email` tab](EMAIL_TAB_URL)** on the same page. Scroll through any reviewer comments left by the ASF Security Team's CVE reviewers. **You do not need to act on reviewer comments yourself** — they arrive by email on `SECURITY_LIST` with the CVE ID in the subject, and sync detects them on the next run, opens corresponding body-field updates on this tracker, and re-pushes the JSON. If the comments tab is empty, or carries a closure note (*"OK, looks good"* / *"approved"*), proceed to the next step.

2. **When the reviewer thread is clear** (no open comments, or all comments have an *"OK, looks good"*-style closer), use the **State** dropdown on `#source` to change `REVIEW` → `READY`. Click **Save**. *The record is now staged for advisory send.*

> 💡 *How do you know the reviewer thread is clear?* Two signals: (a) no new reviewer email on `SECURITY_LIST` carrying the CVE ID for ~3 days, or (b) an explicit "looks good" reply from the reviewer. Most CVEs go through `REVIEW` with no reviewer comments at all — in that case, you can usually move `REVIEW → READY` immediately after Step 1.1's tab-check confirms there's nothing to address.

---

### Step 2 of 3 — preview the advisory email, then send it

With the record in `READY`, click the [`#email` tab](EMAIL_TAB_URL) on the same record page. This shows you, in the exact format that goes out, what the advisory email will look like when sent to `USERS_LIST` and `ANNOUNCE_LIST`.

**Check that:**
- The subject line is `CVE_ID: <one-line description>` and the description matches what you'd want public.
- The body's short-summary paragraph reads as instructions to a user (*"Users are advised to upgrade to version X"*), not just a technical description of the bug.
- The *Affected versions* range is correct.
- The reporter credit line is present and spelled correctly.

**If anything looks wrong**: don't edit it in Vulnogram. Comment on this tracker (just `@potiuk: the X field needs Y`) and we'll fix the corresponding body field here, regenerate the JSON, and re-push within the next sync. Re-preview after that.

**If everything looks right**: click the **Send Email** button on the `#email` tab. The advisory ships to `USERS_LIST` and `ANNOUNCE_LIST`. **That is the only manual send action you make for this CVE.**

> ⚠️ **Do not touch the tracker labels yourself.** Sync flips `fix released` → `announced - emails sent` + `announced` automatically when it sees the advisory in the public archive (usually within the same day). If you flip them manually you race the automation.

---

### Step 3 of 3 — sync closes out the rest (no further action from you)

Once the advisory archives on `lists.apache.org/list.html?USERS_LIST` (typically within minutes of sending), the next sync run does this for you, end-to-end:

1. Captures the published advisory URL into this tracker's body.
2. Regenerates the CVE JSON (now including the archive URL as a `vendor-advisory` reference) and re-pushes it to Vulnogram via the OAuth API.
3. Moves the Vulnogram record `READY` → `PUBLIC` (this is the CNA-feed dispatch — once it lands, `cve.org` starts propagating).
4. Flips this tracker's labels (`fix released` → `announced - emails sent` + `announced`).
5. Closes this tracker as `completed`.
6. **Archives this tracker** from the `Announced` column on the [Security issues board](BOARD_URL) (`archiveProjectV2Item` GraphQL mutation — sync, not you).
7. *(Conditional)* **Closes the [`MILESTONE_TITLE`](MILESTONE_URL) milestone** if this tracker was the last open issue on it.

The CVE will propagate to `cve.org` on its own within a few hours; sync will detect the publication on a subsequent run and post a courtesy *"CVE is live on cve.org"* note to the reporter on the original email thread.

**You're done.** The lifecycle is complete from your side at Step 2 (Send Email). Everything above is sync's job — no further comments will tag you with manual cleanups.
