# Vulnogram — record management

The Vulnogram-side mechanics of **maintaining** a CVE record from
allocation through publication. The generic handling process (steps
13–15 of [`../../README.md`](../../README.md)) describes *what* has
to happen; this file documents the **Vulnogram-specific** *how*.

Per-project URL templates live in
[`../../<project-config>/project.md`](../../<project-config>/project.md#cve-tooling)
(`cve_tool_record_url_template`, `cve_tool_source_tab_url_template`).

## Record URLs

| Purpose | URL |
|---|---|
| Record page (human-readable + edit surface) | `https://cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>` |
| `#source` tab (paste-the-JSON target) | `https://cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>#source` |
| `#json` tab (rendered view of the stored JSON) | `https://cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>#json` |
| `#email` tab (preview the advisory email before sending) | `https://cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>#email` |

The `#email` tab is the **email-preview** surface: it renders the
advisory exactly as Vulnogram will send it to `<users-list>` and
`<announce-list>` — same subject, same body, same recipient list.
The release-manager checklist in
[the *Release-manager checklist* section below](#release-manager-checklist)
calls this out as a load-bearing checkpoint **before** hitting Send,
because the preview surfaces formatting issues (truncation, broken
markdown, missing patch links) that the JSON view does not.

The ASF CVE tool requires ASF OAuth; non-security-team members can
see a record only after it has moved to `PUBLIC` (at which point the
mirrored record at `cve.org/CVERecord?id=<CVE-ID>` is the canonical
public link per the *"Linking CVEs"* section of
[`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)).

## Two record-write paths — API (default) and copy-paste (fallback)

The release manager has two ways to push the CVE JSON onto a
Vulnogram record. **The API path is the default proposal** — it
runs from the same shell the rest of the skills do and removes
the manual paste round-trip. The copy-paste flow stays documented
because (a) ASF-OAuth sessions expire and the API path needs a
re-setup once a session ages out, and (b) some operators prefer
not to keep a session-cookie file on disk at all.

| Path | When | One-liner | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API (default)** | Every paste step in the *Release-manager checklist* below | `uv run --project <framework>/tools/vulnogram/oauth-api vulnogram-api-record-update --cve-id <CVE-ID> --json-file <path>` | One-time `vulnogram-api-setup` per machine — see [`oauth-api/README.md`](oauth-api/README.md) |
| **Copy-paste (fallback)** | Operator opted out (`tools.vulnogram.api_backend: copy_paste` in `.apache-steward-overrides/user.md`), or the API path returned `SessionExpired` and re-setup is deferred | Open `#source`, paste, **Save** (see *[`#source` paste flow](#source-paste-flow)*) | None |

The agentic skills (`security-cve-allocate`, `security-issue-sync`)
run `vulnogram-api-check` before proposing the paste step. Possible
outcomes drive the proposal:

- **`valid` (exit 0)** — propose the API one-liner; the copy-paste
  recipe stays available as a one-line *"or open `#source` and
  paste"* fallback for users who want the visual confirmation.
- **`expired` (exit 1)** — propose `vulnogram-api-setup` first and
  the API one-liner second, with the copy-paste recipe as the
  fallback if the operator wants to skip re-setup for this CVE.
- **`not-configured` (exit 2)** — propose `vulnogram-api-setup`
  with a one-line *"or skip setup and use the copy-paste flow
  below"* hint. **Do not** force setup on an unwilling operator.

State transitions happen at three different layers depending on
which arrow you're crossing:

- **`DRAFT` ↔ `REVIEW`** — sync-driven via the generator. The
  `generate-cve-json` tool emits the correct state in the JSON
  based on body-field readiness; sync pushes via
  `vulnogram-api-record-update`; Vulnogram accepts the state from
  the document body. No separate state-flip call.
- **`REVIEW` → `READY`** — release-manager UI click. The generator
  cannot decide this from the tracker body alone (it depends on
  whether reviewer comments are closed), so it stays a human
  action.
- **`READY` → `PUBLIC`** — sync-driven via the dedicated
  `vulnogram-api-record-publish` CLI, fired when the advisory
  archive URL has been captured. The CLI defaults to refusing
  the publish unless the current state is `REVIEW` (widen with
  `--allow-state` for the rare cases where the RM has already
  moved to `READY` manually).

## `#source` paste flow

The generic release-manager workflow is *"push the final CVE record
and close the issue"* (step 15). On Vulnogram that decomposes into:

1. Open the record's `#source` tab at
   `https://cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>#source`.
2. Copy the CVE JSON from the tracking issue's embedded attachment
   (regenerated by the `generate-cve-json` tool on every sync —
   see the *"Record-generator round trip"* section below).
3. Paste into the `#source` form and **Save**.
4. Use the UI action to move the record from `REVIEW` to `PUBLIC`
   (or from `DRAFT` to `REVIEW` first if the record is still in the
   pre-review state).

`PUBLIC` is the terminal state — Vulnogram pushes the record to
`cve.org` via the CNA feed once the state lands there.

## State machine

Vulnogram wraps every record in a `CNA_private` envelope whose
`state` field drives the visibility + CNA-feed push. The four
states the generic skills interact with:

| State | Set by | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `DRAFT` | Allocation (initial state post-allocation) | Record exists, ID is reserved, but content is still being filled in. Not visible on `cve.org`. |
| `REVIEW` | **Sync, via the generator** (post-2026 convention; see below) | Ready for CNA review. ASF CNA reviewers may leave reviewer comments at this point (see *"Reviewer-comment signal"* below). Still not on `cve.org`. |
| `READY` | Release manager once review feedback is addressed (or immediately after `REVIEW` if no feedback arrived) | Content is final and the record is staged for the advisory-send step. The advisory emails are dispatched from Vulnogram while in `READY`. Still not on `cve.org`. |
| `PUBLIC` | **Sync, via `vulnogram-api-record-publish`**, when the advisory archive URL is captured on the tracker | Record pushed to `cve.org`. World-readable. The generic tracking-issue lifecycle terminates at the `close` action once this state has been reached. |

**`DRAFT` → `REVIEW` — sync-driven via the generator.** The
`generate-cve-json` tool decides `REVIEW` versus `DRAFT` automatically
based on the readiness of the tracker's body fields — see the
`_is_cna_ready_for_review` helper in `generate-cve-json/src/…/cve_json.py`.
When all required fields (CVE ID, title, description, affected
versions, CWE, non-`Unknown` severity, at least one credit, at
least one reference) are populated, the generated JSON carries
`CNA_private.state = "REVIEW"`; when any field is missing, it
carries `"DRAFT"`. Sync pushes the generated JSON verbatim via
`vulnogram-api-record-update`, and Vulnogram accepts the state
field from the document body — no separate state-flip API call
is needed. The release manager **never** has to click `DRAFT` →
`REVIEW` manually; the `security-issue-sync` skill gates the RM
hand-off on the post-push state being `REVIEW` (see
[`security-issue-sync` Step 2b *Two-stage gate*](../../.claude/skills/security-issue-sync/SKILL.md)).

**`REVIEW` → `READY` — release-manager UI click.** Happens once any
reviewer comments have been addressed (via the body-field
round-trip described in the *Record-generator round trip* section
below), or immediately after `REVIEW` when no comments arrive.
`READY` is the state Vulnogram expects when the release manager
triggers the advisory email send. The generator does not emit
`READY` directly because it cannot tell, from the tracker body
alone, whether reviewer comments are still pending — that
judgement stays with the RM.

**`READY` → `PUBLIC` — sync-driven via `vulnogram-api-record-publish`**,
fired when the advisory archive URL has been captured on
`lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>` (the real-world signal
the advisory has actually shipped). This transition was
historically a manual RM click because it triggers the CNA-feed
dispatch to `cve.org`; the post-2026 convention drives it from
sync because the captured archive URL is the same signal a human
would use to decide it is safe to flip.

`PUBLISHED` is sometimes used as a synonym for `PUBLIC` in older
Vulnogram documentation; the current action is literally labelled
`PUBLIC` in the UI.

## Reviewer-comment signal

ASF CNA reviewers leave comments on `REVIEW`-state records. Those
comments do **not** surface on the tracking issue directly —
Vulnogram notifies by email to the project's `security_list`
instead, with the CVE ID in the subject line. The `security-issue-sync`
skill's Step 1e reads those emails (Gmail search recipe lives in
[`../gmail/search-queries.md`](../gmail/search-queries.md#security-issue-sync--cve-review-comment-search))
and surfaces each open reviewer comment in Step 2b as an actionable
body-field proposal on the tracker.

The round trip is: reviewer leaves comment in Vulnogram → Vulnogram
emails `security_list` → sync skill reads email → sync skill proposes
a tracker body-field update → user confirms → `generate-cve-json`
re-emits the JSON attachment on the next sync → release manager
re-pastes the updated JSON into `#source` → `sync` detects the
comment is resolved on the next run. This indirection keeps the
single source of truth on the **tracking issue body** (which the
skills can read + write) rather than inside Vulnogram (which is
OAuth-gated and not readable from skill context).

The `cveprocess.apache.org/cve5/<CVE-ID>.json` endpoint exists but
is behind ASF OAuth and is **not** readable from agent-skill
context — the `security-issue-sync` skill therefore never curls it;
Gmail is the load-bearing signal source.

## Record-generator round trip

The `generate-cve-json` tool under
[`generate-cve-json/`](generate-cve-json/) reads a tracker issue and
emits a paste-ready CVE JSON record in the exact shape Vulnogram's
`#source` tab accepts — CNA container, `CNA_private` envelope,
sorted references, deterministic byte output. The tool's behavioural
contract lives in
[`generate-cve-json/SKILL.md`](generate-cve-json/SKILL.md); the
local-setup / test workflow lives in
[`generate-cve-json/README.md`](generate-cve-json/README.md).

Skills that update the tracker body call the tool with `--attach` so
the embedded CVE JSON in the tracker body stays in lock-step with
the body fields — every sync, every allocate-CVE wire-back, every
dedupe merge regenerates the attachment. The release manager then
has one canonical JSON to paste into `#source` at step 15.

## Release-manager checklist

When the `<upstream>` release containing a fix ships, the
`security-issue-sync` skill swaps the tracker's `pr merged` label to
`fix released`, reassigns the issue to the release manager, and posts
an explicit **release-manager hand-off comment** on the tracker (the
template body lives in
[`release-manager-handoff-comment.md`](release-manager-handoff-comment.md)).
The numbered checklist below is the standalone authoritative recipe
the comment links to — keep them in lock-step when one changes.

The flow has **two writes** in the common case (no reviewer comments)
and **three** when reviewer comments arrive. Each write lands on the
record via either the API (default — see
[*Two record-write paths*](#two-record-write-paths--api-default-and-copy-paste-fallback))
or copy-paste (fallback). The instructions below show the API form
inline; the copy-paste form is the *"open `#source`, paste, Save"*
flow described in [*`#source` paste flow*](#source-paste-flow):

1. **(pre-handoff, sync-driven) — record reaches `REVIEW` state.**
   The release manager picks up the tracker with the record
   *already* in `REVIEW` state. Sync pushes the
   generator-emitted JSON via `vulnogram-api-record-update` and
   the generator emits `CNA_private.state = "REVIEW"` when all
   the required body fields are populated. The hand-off comment
   the RM receives only fires once sync confirms the post-push
   state is `REVIEW` — until then the tracker stays with the
   remediation developer and a [*fill missing fields*](remediation-developer-fill-fields-comment.md)
   comment names what's blocking. **The RM never performs the
   `DRAFT` → `REVIEW` click.**

2. **(conditional) Body-field round-trip after reviewer comments.**
   ASF CNA reviewers may leave comments while the record sits in
   `REVIEW` (see [*Reviewer-comment signal*](#reviewer-comment-signal)
   above). The `security-issue-sync` skill detects them
   automatically and proposes matching body-field updates on the
   tracker; the security team confirms and the embedded JSON
   regenerates. Sync re-pushes via the same
   `vulnogram-api-record-update` call. **As the RM, you wait
   for the security team's next sync** — the round-trip is fully
   handled there; you only watch the `#email` tab for the
   reviewer thread to close. **Skip this step if no reviewer
   comments arrived** (the common case for well-formed records).

3. **Set `READY`.** Vulnogram UI action — moves the record from
   `REVIEW` to `READY` and stages it for the advisory-send step.
   This is the **first** state-flip the RM performs; the
   generator cannot do it (it cannot tell from the tracker body
   alone whether reviewer comments are closed).

4. **Preview the advisory email** on the
   [`#email` tab](#record-urls). The preview renders the advisory
   exactly as Vulnogram will send it — same subject, same body, same
   recipient list. The preview is the load-bearing checkpoint for
   formatting issues (truncation, broken markdown, missing patch
   links) that the JSON view does not surface. **Always preview
   before sending.** If anything needs to change, edit the
   corresponding body field on the tracker, wait for the JSON to
   regenerate, re-paste in `#source`, and re-preview.

5. **Send the advisory emails.** Vulnogram dispatches to
   `<users-list>` and `<announce-list>`. On the tracker, add the
   `announced - emails sent` label and remove `fix released`.

6. **Wait for the publication-ready notification comment.** The
   `security-issue-sync` skill scans the public users-list archive
   for the CVE ID on every run. Once it finds the archived advisory,
   it populates the tracker's *Public advisory URL* body field,
   regenerates the CVE JSON to carry the archive URL as a
   `vendor-advisory` reference, adds the `announced` label, **and
   posts a publication-ready notification comment** on the tracker
   (the template body lives in
   [`release-manager-publication-comment.md`](release-manager-publication-comment.md)).
   That comment is the explicit go-ahead for steps 7-8.

7. **(sync-driven) — record reaches `PUBLIC`.** *Fires
   automatically once the publication-ready notification has
   landed.* On its next pass, sync re-pushes the regenerated
   JSON (now carrying the archive URL as a `vendor-advisory`
   reference) and then moves the record `READY` → `PUBLIC` via
   the dedicated `vulnogram-api-record-publish` CLI (which keys
   off the captured archive URL — the real-world signal that
   the advisory shipped). **The RM does not perform the
   `READY` → `PUBLIC` click.**

8. **Close the tracker.** Sync's apply step closes the tracker
   as completed (do not update labels) and archives the
   project-board item afterwards (per the *archive-from-board*
   recipe in [`../github/project-board.md`](../github/project-board.md)).
   The RM's last touchpoint is the wrap-up comment sync posts
   on the tracker — archive from the `Announced` column on the
   board and (conditionally) close the milestone if the just-
   closed tracker was the last open issue on it.

**RM-side write count** is **zero** in the common case (no
reviewer comments): sync handles steps 1, 2, 6, 7, 8; the RM
clicks `REVIEW` → `READY` (step 3), previews the advisory
(step 4), and sends it (step 5). When reviewer comments arrive,
the round-trip in step 2 is also handled by sync; the RM still
performs only steps 3–5. The hand-off comment (template at
[`release-manager-handoff-comment.md`](release-manager-handoff-comment.md))
walks the RM through their three actions without invoking any
`uv run` commands; keep both in lock-step when one changes.
