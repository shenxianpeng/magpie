# oauth-draft

Small Python project that talks directly to the Gmail REST API on a
user-provided OAuth refresh token. Three console scripts:

| Console script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `oauth-draft-setup` | One-time interactive OAuth consent flow that writes the credentials JSON. |
| `oauth-draft-create` | Create a Gmail draft with `threadId` attachment. (As of the `replyToMessageId` parameter on the claude.ai Gmail MCP `create_draft`, the MCP can also produce thread-attached drafts — see [`../draft-backends.md`](../draft-backends.md). This script remains useful when you have a `threadId` on hand and would rather skip the extra `get_thread` round-trip the MCP path requires, and is the only path that lets the skills delete drafts via the Gmail API afterwards.) |
| `oauth-draft-mark-read` | Bulk-modify Gmail threads matching a search query (default: mark as read by removing the `UNREAD` label). No MCP equivalent today. |

The default and recommended drafting backend is the claude.ai Gmail
MCP — see [`../draft-backends.md`](../draft-backends.md) for when to
opt into `oauth_curl`. This README covers local-setup, day-to-day
invocation, and the project's own test/lint workflow.

## Run

From the framework's root (this repository when running standalone;
the `.apache-magpie/` snapshot path inside an adopting tracker repo):

```bash
uv run --project tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-create \
  --thread-id <gmail-threadId> \
  --to reporter@example.com \
  --cc security@<project>.apache.org \
  --subject "Re: <root subject>" \
  --body-file /path/to/body.txt
```

Skill files and framework docs reference the same invocation via the
`<framework>` placeholder so the path resolves in either context:

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-create ...
```

`<framework>` substitutes to `.apache-magpie/apache-steward` in
adopting projects and to `.` (the repository root) in framework
standalone — see the placeholder convention in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md#placeholder-convention-used-in-skill-files).

The other two scripts follow the same shape:

```bash
# Bulk mark-as-read (dry-run by default; add --execute to actually modify)
uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-mark-read \
  --query 'label:apache-security in:spam is:unread'

# Add --execute after reviewing the dry-run output
uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-mark-read \
  --query 'label:apache-security in:spam is:unread' --execute
```

Per-flag help: `oauth-draft-create --help`,
`oauth-draft-mark-read --help`, `oauth-draft-setup --help`.

## Setup — one-time

You need a Google OAuth client with the `https://mail.google.com/`
scope, and a refresh token issued against the Gmail account you use
for `security@<project>.apache.org` triage.

1. **Create a Google Cloud project** (if you don't already have one
   for this purpose). Enable the Gmail API.

2. **Create an OAuth client** of type *Desktop app*. Download the
   credentials JSON (call it `client_secrets.json`).

3. **Run the consent flow** with the downloaded `client_secrets.json`.
   `oauth-draft-setup` opens a browser tab against Google's consent
   screen, captures the auth code on a local-bound port, exchanges it
   for a refresh token, and writes the credentials file in the shape
   the other two scripts expect:

   ```bash
   uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-setup \
     /path/to/client_secrets.json
   ```

   Optional flags:

   | Flag | Purpose |
   |---|---|
   | `--from-address` | Address baked into the credentials file as the outgoing `From:`. Defaults to `$GMAIL_FROM`, then `git config user.email`. |
   | `--out` | Output path. Default: `~/.config/apache-magpie/gmail-oauth.json`. |
   | `--rm-client-secrets` | Delete the input `client_secrets.json` after writing the credentials file. |

   The script writes the credentials atomically with mode 600 and
   chmods the parent directory to 700. The refresh token it stores is
   the long-lived secret of the whole `oauth_curl` backend; treat
   the file like an SSH private key.

4. **Smoke-test** by running a dry-run thread search:

   ```bash
   uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft oauth-draft-mark-read \
     --query 'in:inbox is:unread' --max 3
   ```

   This exercises `Credentials.load → refresh_access_token →
   threads.list` without modifying anything. A non-empty list of
   thread IDs (or *"Found 0 matching thread(s)"*) means the
   credentials work.

## How threading is guaranteed

When `oauth-draft-create` is invoked with `--thread-id`, the script
does three things, in order:

1. Refreshes a short-lived access token from the stored refresh token.
2. Reads the chronologically-last message in the thread and extracts
   its `Message-ID` header (and the existing `References` chain).
3. Builds an RFC822 MIME message with `In-Reply-To: <that-Message-ID>`
   and `References: <existing chain> <that-Message-ID>`, plus sets
   `threadId` in the Gmail API call.

Gmail's server-side threader attaches by `threadId`; every other mail
client that receives the message threads by `References` /
`In-Reply-To` chain. Both paths agree, so the draft lands on the same
conversation for everyone.

Pass `--no-reply-headers` to skip step 2 (useful only for smoke
testing — production drafts always want the headers set).

## Confidentiality

The refresh token grants full read/draft access to your Gmail. Treat
it like an SSH key:

- The setup script writes the file with mode 600 and chmods its parent
  directory to 700; do not loosen those.
- Do **not** commit the credentials file. The path lives outside the
  repo tree by default (`~/.config/apache-magpie/gmail-oauth.json`).
- Revoke the refresh token at
  <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions> if you suspect it has
  leaked.

## Test

```bash
cd tools/gmail/oauth-draft
uv run --group dev pytest
```

## Lint / type-check

```bash
cd tools/gmail/oauth-draft
uv run --group dev ruff check src tests
uv run --group dev ruff format --check src tests
uv run --group dev mypy
```

The `prek` hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the
repository root run `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy`,
and `pytest` on the project files automatically on every commit
that touches them.
