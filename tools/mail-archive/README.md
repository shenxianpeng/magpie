# tools/mail-archive/

**Capability:** contract:mail-archive

**Kind:** interface

**Vendor:** agnostic

This file defines the adapter contract for **public mail-archive
backends** — the seam that lets adopting projects plug a non-ASF
archive system (Hyperkitty, Discourse, Google Groups, GitHub
Discussions, or none at all) into the same skills that today reach
straight into `lists.apache.org` via the PonyMail MCP. The contract
declares *verbs* that the generic skill bodies call, with input and
output shapes that every backend must satisfy; the concrete URL
construction, authentication model, and search syntax stay inside
each adapter directory.

The contract exists because the skills currently hard-code two
ASF-specific assumptions in their step bodies:

1. They call `mcp__ponymail__search_list`, `mcp__ponymail__get_thread`,
   `mcp__ponymail__list_recent_threads`, and friends by name — the
   `mcp__ponymail__*` prefix is woven into roughly two dozen step
   bodies across `security-issue-import`, `security-issue-sync`, and
   `security-issue-invalidate`.
2. They construct `https://lists.apache.org/...` URLs inline (the
   `list?<list>:YYYY-M:<query>` search form, the
   `api/thread.lua?...` JSON form, the
   `thread/<hash>?<list>` resolved form, and the
   `list.html?<users-list>` advisory-published form) from
   `<list>` / `<list-domain>` / `<month>` placeholders that come
   from the project manifest.

Both assumptions are documented today in
[`tools/gmail/ponymail-archive.md`](../gmail/ponymail-archive.md) and
in [`tools/ponymail/operations.md`](../ponymail/operations.md). PR1
introduces this contract so that PR3 can rename `tools/ponymail/`
to `tools/mail-archive-ponymail/` without disturbing the skills, and
so that later PRs can refactor every `mcp__ponymail__*` call site
and every `lists.apache.org` URL template to flow through the verbs
declared here.

ASF projects keep the existing PonyMail behaviour by default. A
non-ASF adopter declares a different `archive_system.kind` in
`projects/<project>/project.md` and the adapter for that kind is
loaded in place of PonyMail. Skills do not change.

## Prerequisites

- **Runtime:** None of its own — this file is an adapter-contract
  *specification* (pure Markdown). Concrete prerequisites belong to
  whichever adapter the project declares.
- **CLIs:** None for the contract itself.
- **Credentials / auth:** Per adapter. The shipping `ponymail`
  adapter needs ASF LDAP OAuth for private lists (`security@`,
  `private@`) and anonymous read for public lists; the placeholder
  adapters (Hyperkitty / Discourse / Google Groups / GitHub
  Discussions / none) each bring their own auth model.
- **Network:** Per adapter. The ASF default reaches
  `lists.apache.org`; the `none` adapter performs no network access.

## Today's adapters

| Adapter | Status | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ponymail` | shipping | [`tools/ponymail/`](../ponymail/) (will be renamed to `tools/mail-archive-ponymail/` in PR3) | ASF's `lists.apache.org` deployment; PMC LDAP OAuth for private lists; anonymous read for public lists; load-bearing for the `security-issue-import`, `security-issue-sync`, and `security-issue-invalidate` skills today. |
| `hyperkitty` | placeholder | not implemented | Mailman 3's archive UI. Same conceptual surface as PonyMail (per-list archive, search by month + query, per-thread permalink) but a different URL grammar and a different JSON API. |
| `discourse` | placeholder | not implemented | Topic-based forum, with mailing-list-mode bridging. The verbs map onto Discourse's `/search.json` and `/t/<slug>/<id>.json` endpoints. |
| `google-groups` | placeholder | not implemented | `groups.google.com` archives. Lacks a stable JSON read API; an adapter likely degrades to user-paste for the per-thread URL, the same way PonyMail does for private lists. |
| `github-discussions` | placeholder | not implemented | GitHub's discussions feature, accessed via the GraphQL API the `gh` CLI already wraps. Useful for projects whose announcement channel is a `discussions` category rather than a mailing list. |
| `none` | placeholder | not implemented | Explicit *"no archive backend"* declaration. Every verb returns `null` / no-op; the consuming skill falls back to user-paste or to a *"not available"* note in the tracker body field. Useful for projects that do not host their security discussions on an archived list at all (private-only intake forms, chat-channel intake). |

The ASF default adapter is the only one that ships today. Every
placeholder above is named, with a one-paragraph justification, so
that an adopter who needs that backend can author the adapter
without re-inventing the contract.

The PonyMail adapter's `search_thread_url` template,
`fetch_thread_by_url` recipes, `list_recent_threads` filter, and
`publication_signal_url` all live in
[`tools/ponymail/`](../ponymail/). This is the only mail-archive
adapter shipping today; the contract above describes the interface
for additional adapters (Hyperkitty / Discourse / Google Groups /
GitHub Discussions / none).

The skills that consume this contract today are:

- [`security-issue-import`](../../skills/security-issue-import/SKILL.md)
  — PonyMail URL construction at receipt time (Step 5: per-month
  search URL + per-thread permalink verification).
- [`security-issue-sync`](../../skills/security-issue-sync/SKILL.md)
  — Step 1c / 1e / 1h / 2b — thread lookup and advisory-published
  signal scan.
- [`security-issue-invalidate`](../../skills/security-issue-invalidate/SKILL.md)
  — relay-thread search for the closing-reply step.

## Interface

Every adapter exposes the verbs below. Each verb declares:

- **When it fires** — the skill lifecycle point that calls the verb.
- **Inputs** — the typed arguments.
- **Output shape** — the return type, including the `null` / no-op
  shape when the backend cannot resolve the request.

The output shapes are documented in conceptual terms rather than as
a strict JSON schema; an adapter is free to return a language-native
object as long as the consuming skill can read the named fields.

### `search_thread_url(list, year, month, query) to string`

**When it fires.** Step 5 of `security-issue-import` — the skill
needs a one-click URL the user can open in their authenticated
browser to land on the inbound report's archive page. Also fires
inside `security-issue-invalidate` when the relay-rewritten
inbound thread needs to be located for the closing reply.

**Inputs.**

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | string | The fully-qualified mailing-list address. For ASF: `security@<project>.apache.org`. Adapters that don't use email addresses (Discourse, GitHub Discussions) interpret this as the channel identifier. |
| `year` | integer | Four-digit Gregorian year, e.g. `2026`. |
| `month` | integer | 1–12. The adapter is responsible for formatting (PonyMail wants `YYYY-M`, no leading zero; Hyperkitty wants `YYYY-MM`). |
| `query` | string | The search query in the adapter's native dialect — typically the report subject for `security-issue-import`, the CVE ID for advisory scans. The adapter is free to URL-encode, escape, or transform as needed. |

**Output.** A complete URL string that a human can open in a
browser to land on the search results. The skill proposes this URL
to the user at Step 5 of `security-issue-import` and waits for the
user to paste back the resolved per-thread URL.

**No-op case.** Adapters that cannot generate a search URL (the
`none` adapter, or a backend that gates search behind an interactive
session) return an empty string. The skill treats an empty return
as *"no search URL available, fall back to user-paste with no
prompt URL"*.

### `fetch_thread_by_url(url) to thread_data | null`

**When it fires.** Step 1c / 1e / 1h / 2b of `security-issue-sync`
— when the tracker already carries an archive thread URL and the
sync skill wants to re-read the discussion for new mailing-list
activity since the last sync. Also fires inside `security-issue-import`
when the user pastes a URL back and the skill wants to verify the
URL resolves before recording it in the tracker body field.

**Inputs.**

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | A URL the adapter previously produced via `search_thread_url` or via `resolve_advisory_announcement_url`. The adapter is responsible for parsing its own URL grammar. |

**Output.** A `thread_data` object with at least:

- `thread_id` — the adapter's opaque per-thread identifier.
- `list` — the list address (echoed from the URL for adapter consistency).
- `subject` — the thread subject.
- `messages[]` — an array of `{message_id, from, date, body, in_reply_to}` records, ordered by date.
- `participant_handles[]` — every distinct sender, formatted as the adapter's native handle (email address for mailing-list adapters; `@user` for Discourse; `@user` for GitHub Discussions).

**No-op case.** Returns `null` when:

- The URL is well-formed but the thread no longer exists (deleted /
  retracted / archive purged).
- The URL is well-formed but requires authentication the adapter
  doesn't have (the `ponymail` adapter against a private list when
  the user has not run `mcp__ponymail__login`).
- The URL is malformed (parsing failure).

Skills handle a `null` return by surfacing the gap to the user at
the next sync — they do not retry automatically.

### `list_recent_threads(list, since) to [thread_summary]`

**When it fires.** Periodic-sweep bodies (`security-issue-import`
when it scans `security@` for unimported threads;
`security-issue-sync` when it scans `users@` for `[RESULT][VOTE]`
announcements). Also fires on the *"check for new activity on this
list"* shortcut path used by triage sweeps.

**Inputs.**

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | string | The fully-qualified list address. |
| `since` | ISO-8601 date or relative duration string | The lower bound for the scan window. Adapters that don't accept a free-form `since` are expected to translate (PonyMail takes a `d=lte=` / `d=gte=` syntax; Hyperkitty takes a `?date=` param; Discourse takes an `after:` operator). |

**Output.** An array of `thread_summary` records, each at minimum:

- `thread_id`
- `subject`
- `first_message_date`
- `last_message_date`
- `message_count`
- `permalink` — the URL `fetch_thread_by_url` would accept.

Ordering is *newest-first by `last_message_date`*. Adapters that
return an unordered set internally must sort before returning.

**No-op case.** Returns `[]` (empty array) when the list has no
activity in the requested window, or when authentication is
missing and the list is private. Empty `[]` and *"no access"* are
indistinguishable from the skill's perspective by design — the
skill surfaces the gap without distinguishing reason.

### `resolve_advisory_announcement_url(list, advisory_id) to string | null`

**When it fires.** Step 1h / Step 2b of `security-issue-sync` — the
sync skill polls for the *"advisory archived on `<users-list>`"*
signal that flips the tracker from `fix released` to `announced`.
Today the ASF adapter resolves this by curling
`https://lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>:YYYY:<CVE-ID>` and
checking for a 200 response with a thread hit; other adapters
implement the equivalent against their own search APIs.

**Inputs.**

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | string | The public announcement list address (`<users-list>` or `<announce-list>` for ASF). |
| `advisory_id` | string | The advisory identifier the skill is scanning for — typically the CVE ID once `cve_authority.publish` has fired, but could equally be a GHSA ID for projects using GHSA as their `cve_authority.tool`. |

**Output.** The resolved permalink for the advisory thread
(equivalent to the return shape of `search_thread_url` but already
narrowed to the single matched thread), or `null` when no thread
matches.

**No-op case.** Returns `null` when:

- No thread mentions the advisory ID on the named list within the
  adapter's default scan window.
- The list is private and the adapter has no access (the
  announcement list should always be public, so this is an
  adapter-misconfiguration signal — the skill flags it but does
  not retry).
- The adapter is `none` (no archive backend declared).

The skill treats `null` as *"not yet archived"* and re-checks on the
next sync run. A non-null return is a load-bearing signal — it
triggers the multi-step `fix released to announced` close-out flow
in `security-issue-sync` Step 4 (label flips, CVE JSON
regeneration, Vulnogram `REVIEW to PUBLIC` push, milestone close,
board archival, RM hand-off comment).

### `publication_signal_url(list) to string`

**When it fires.** On every `security-issue-sync` run that has the
*"public-advisory-url not yet populated"* condition — the skill
needs the URL that *flips visible* when a release-announcement is
archived, so it can present it to the user as a one-click verify
URL alongside the `resolve_advisory_announcement_url` programmatic
scan.

**Inputs.**

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | string | The announcement list address. |

**Output.** A URL pointing at the list's *most-recent-activity*
view. For PonyMail this is
`https://lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>` (the unfiltered
list-index page that updates as new messages arrive). For
Hyperkitty this is `https://<archive-host>/archives/list/<list>/`.
For Discourse this is the category permalink. The skill embeds the
URL in informational comments and in the *"check for advisory
archive"* sync prompt.

**No-op case.** Adapters that have no concept of *"most-recent-
activity page"* (the `none` adapter; some Discourse configurations)
return an empty string. The skill omits the verify-URL line from
its sync prompt when this happens.

## Skills that consume this contract

| Skill | Where the call lives today | Verb |
|---|---|---|
| `security-issue-import` | Step 5 — *"PonyMail URL construction"* — the skill builds the per-month search URL from the project manifest's `<security-list>` value plus the inbound message's received-month, proposes it to the user, and waits for the resolved per-thread URL to be pasted back. | `search_thread_url(list=<security-list>, year, month, query=<subject>)` for the prompt URL; `fetch_thread_by_url(url=<pasted-url>)` for the verification step. |
| `security-issue-sync` | Step 1c — *"check the mailing-list thread for new activity since last sync"*. | `fetch_thread_by_url(url=<security-thread-field>)` re-read; the skill diffs participants and message dates against the previous sync. |
| `security-issue-sync` | Step 1e — *"locate the `[RESULT][VOTE]` thread for the release that ships this CVE"*. | `list_recent_threads(list=<dev-list>, since=<vote-window-start>)` filtered for `[RESULT][VOTE]` subject prefix. |
| `security-issue-sync` | Step 1h — *"has the advisory been archived on `<users-list>` yet?"*. | `resolve_advisory_announcement_url(list=<users-list>, advisory_id=<CVE-ID>)`; non-null return triggers the close-out flow. |
| `security-issue-sync` | Step 2b — *"present the verify URL to the user alongside the programmatic scan result"*. | `publication_signal_url(list=<users-list>)`. |
| `security-issue-invalidate` | Closing-reply step — *"locate the original relay-rewritten inbound thread so the polite-but-firm rejection lands on the right archive entry"*. | `search_thread_url(list=<security-list>, year, month, query=<subject>)`; the skill cross-checks against the tracker's *security-thread* body field. |

Every call site listed above currently hard-codes `mcp__ponymail__*`
or constructs a `https://lists.apache.org/...` URL inline. PR3
refactors the call sites to flow through the verbs declared in this
contract; PR1 (this PR) only declares the contract.

## ASF default — PonyMail

The ASF default adapter is documented today at
[`tools/ponymail/`](../ponymail/) (read-side via the
[`apache/comdev` `mcp/ponymail-mcp/`](https://github.com/apache/comdev/tree/main/mcp/ponymail-mcp)
MCP server) and [`tools/gmail/ponymail-archive.md`](../gmail/ponymail-archive.md)
(URL-template form used for in-tracker cross-links).

URL-construction shape that the ASF adapter satisfies:

| Verb | URL template |
|---|---|
| `search_thread_url` | `https://lists.apache.org/list?<list>:YYYY-M:<url-encoded query>` |
| `fetch_thread_by_url` | `https://lists.apache.org/api/thread.lua?list=<list-local>&domain=<list-domain>&q=<search>` (JSON read), backed by `https://lists.apache.org/thread/<hash>?<list>` (the canonical per-thread permalink the skill stores in tracker body fields) |
| `list_recent_threads` | `https://lists.apache.org/api/stats.lua?list=<list-local>&domain=<list-domain>&d=lte=<since>` |
| `resolve_advisory_announcement_url` | `https://lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>:YYYY:<CVE-ID>` (text-mode existence check), resolving to `https://lists.apache.org/thread/<hash>?<users-list>` on a hit |
| `publication_signal_url` | `https://lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>` |

Month-token format note: the PonyMail search URL takes the month
**without a leading zero** (`2026-4`, not `2026-04`). Adapters that
front-end a backend with a different convention (Hyperkitty uses
`2026-04`) must normalise at the boundary.

Auth note: private-list reads (`security@<project>.apache.org`,
`private@<project>.apache.org`) require an authenticated PonyMail
MCP session (PMC LDAP OAuth). The first-login flow is documented
in [`tools/ponymail/tool.md`](../ponymail/tool.md#setup) and is run
once per workstation; the session cookie is cached at
`~/.ponymail-mcp/session.json`.

**Rename plan.** PR3 of this refactor renames `tools/ponymail/` to
`tools/mail-archive-ponymail/` and updates every cross-link. The
directory contents stay the same — only the path moves. PR1 (this
PR) keeps the existing path so the diff stays minimal and reviewable.

## Configuration

The adapter selection lives in `projects/<project>/project.md`
under the `archive_system` block:

```yaml
# archive_system — public mail-archive backend
# ASF default: ponymail (lists.apache.org)
archive_system:
  kind: ponymail               # ASF default; override per-adopter for hyperkitty | discourse | google-groups | github-discussions | none
  list_domain: <project>.apache.org   # ASF default; the list's domain component
  search_url_template: https://lists.apache.org/list?{list}:{year}-{month}:{query}
                                # ASF default; the URL `search_thread_url` returns
  api_query_url_template: https://lists.apache.org/api/thread.lua?list={list_local}&domain={list_domain}&q={query}
                                # ASF default; the URL `fetch_thread_by_url` reads
  advisory_publication_signal_url: https://lists.apache.org/list.html?<users-list>
                                # ASF default; the URL `publication_signal_url` returns
```

Adopters override per-field. A Hyperkitty deployment would set
`kind: hyperkitty`, point `search_url_template` at
`https://<archive-host>/hyperkitty/list/{list}/{year}/{month}/?q={query}`,
and the rest follows. A project that has no archive backend at all
declares `kind: none` and the skills degrade — `search_thread_url`
returns empty, `fetch_thread_by_url` returns `null`, and the
tracker body fields fall back to the *"not available, see Gmail
thread `<threadId>`"* textual note.

Adapter selection is *purely declarative*. The skill bodies do not
branch on `kind` — they call the verbs, and the dispatch into the
adapter happens at the contract boundary. This is the property that
makes the contract a stable seam: adding `discourse` later is a
new directory under `tools/mail-archive-<name>/`, not a change to
the skills.
