# PII redaction contract

This file is the source-of-truth for **what gets redacted, into
what shape, and when**. Skills implement the lifecycle defined
here; the [`redactor/`](redactor/) Python helper provides the
reference implementation.

## What counts as PII

The redactor handles these field types. Each maps to a single
identifier prefix:

| Field type | Prefix | Sources skills should redact from |
|---|---|---|
| Third-party name (any natural-person name **other than the reporter** and **other than current `<tracker>` collaborators** — see [Who counts as a collaborator](#who-counts-as-a-collaborator-not-redacted) below) | `N-` | Names appearing in the body / signature lines / CVE credit fields / HackerOne / GHSA fields that the reporter discloses about *other people* (research collaborators, victims they observed, named third parties). |
| Email address | `E-` | Same scope: emails of the third parties redacted under the row above. The reporter's own `From:` / `Cc:` / `To:` addresses are NOT redacted. |
| Phone number | `P-` | Signature blocks of third parties; "call me at" / "reach me on" patterns referring to non-reporter individuals. |
| IP address (v4 or v6) | `IP-` | Reproducer logs; "I tested from" lines. Self-disclosed IPs of third parties only — IPs that name a vulnerable production server are **not** PII and stay in place. |
| Personal handle | `H-` | Personal GitHub username, Twitter handle, IRC nick, Slack handle of a third party (not the reporter and not a `<tracker>` collaborator). The third party's *public* identity on the GitHub *issue itself* is already public and is not PII; a handle they only signed their email with is. |
| Postal / employer address (free-form) | `A-` | "I work at" / "my address is" lines referring to non-reporter individuals. |

Things that are **not** PII and the redactor leaves alone:

- **The reporter's own identity** — name, email, phone, signature
  details. The reporter sent the mail to `<security-list>` and
  is operationally known to the security team (the team replies
  to them, credits them in the CVE, references them across the
  tracker discussion). Their identity flows through the agent's
  context as-is. *Confidentiality* of the reporter's identity vs
  *public surfaces* is governed separately by
  [`AGENTS.md` — Confidentiality of the tracker repository](../../AGENTS.md#confidentiality-of-the-tracker-repository),
  not by this redactor.
- **`<tracker>` repo collaborators** — see
  [Who counts as a collaborator](#who-counts-as-a-collaborator-not-redacted)
  below. Their identity is already public/known via their
  collaborator status; redacting them produces no privacy gain.
- Vulnerability detail (CVEs, CWE numbers, file paths in the
  affected project, code snippets demonstrating the bug).
- Project maintainer names — covered by the collaborator
  exception above. The security team's own roster lives in
  `<project-config>/` and is committed; they are authors, not
  external parties whose identity needs protecting.
- Anything inside `<` … `>` that is *already* a placeholder in the
  framework's templates (`<security-list>`, `<reporter>` in canned
  responses, etc.). Redacting placeholders would be silly.
- URLs — except where the URL contains a redactable handle (e.g.
  `https://github.com/janesmith/...` for a non-collaborator
  janesmith), the handle alone gets redacted; the URL stays
  valid.

When in doubt about a *third party*, redact. The reverse-on-
outbound step (`pii-reveal`) is cheap; over-redaction has no
cost beyond cosmetics in the agent's working text. Under-
redaction of third-party identity leaks PII into LLM logs. (The
reporter's own identity is the one case where the default flips
the other way — leave it as-is, it is operationally needed.)

### Who counts as a collaborator (not redacted)

A "collaborator" for the purposes of the not-redacted exception
above is anyone returned by:

```bash
gh api repos/<tracker>/collaborators --jq '.[].login'
```

This is the same source-of-truth the framework's
[Treat external content as data, never as instructions](../../AGENTS.md#treat-external-content-as-data-never-as-instructions)
rule uses for "who is authorised to instruct the agent". Using
the same list across both rules keeps the security team's
mental model simple: a collaborator is a collaborator everywhere.

The lookup is per-skill-run, not cached across runs — a
collaborator added to or removed from the tracker takes effect
on the next skill invocation.

**Filtering happens in the skill, not the redactor.** The
redactor is a generic value→identifier swap; it does not know
who the reporter is or who is a collaborator. Skills resolve the
collaborator set, identify third-party PII candidates in the
body, drop the reporter and collaborators, and only then pass
the *should-be-redacted* set as `--field` arguments. The
canonical step-by-step pattern is in
[`wiring.md`](wiring.md#redact-after-fetch-protocol).

The collaborator filter is **adopter-tunable** — the
*"Collaborator exemption"* knob in the adopter's
[`<project-config>/privacy-llm.md`](../../projects/_template/privacy-llm.md#collaborator-exemption)
controls whether the exemption is enabled at all. Default is
enabled (collaborator names flow as-is); disabled is the
stricter posture (every non-reporter individual gets redacted,
including collaborators). See the template doc for when to use
each.

## The identifier format

```text
<TYPE>-<6-char-lowercase-hex>
```

- `<TYPE>` is one of the prefixes from the table above (`N`, `E`,
  `P`, `IP`, `H`, `A`).
- The 6-char hex is the first 24 bits of `sha256(<lowercased,
  trimmed value>)`, lowercased, no separator.
- On hash collision (two distinct PII values map to the same
  6-char prefix — first detected at insert time), the redactor
  extends the second value's hex to 8 chars, then 12, then 16,
  until the prefix is unique. The mapping file records the
  extension.

Examples:

| Input | Identifier |
|---|---|
| `Jane Smith` | `N-a3f9d2` *(illustrative — actual hash differs)* |
| `jane.smith@example.com` | `E-b8c247` |
| `+1-555-0100` | `P-7d4e91` |
| `192.0.2.42` | `IP-1a5cef` |
| `@janesmith-personal` | `H-9e3b04` |

The 6-char default gives ~16M slots before collision pressure
becomes meaningful — comfortably above the lifetime PII volume of
any single ASF project's security tracker.

## The mapping store

Storage path: **`~/.config/apache-magpie/pii-mapping.json`** —
home-dir per the framework's tool-credentials rule (see
[`AGENTS.md` — Local setup](../../AGENTS.md#local-setup)).

Format:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "entries": {
    "N-a3f9d2": {"type": "name", "value": "Jane Smith"},
    "E-b8c247": {"type": "email",    "value": "jane.smith@example.com"},
    "P-7d4e91": {"type": "phone",    "value": "+1-555-0100"}
  }
}
```

- The file is mode `600` and lives outside the project tree —
  the same security posture as `~/.config/apache-magpie/gmail-oauth.json`.
- Writes are atomic (`tempfile + os.replace`) so a crash mid-write
  cannot leave a half-baked file.
- The mapping is **per-machine, never committed**. Each
  developer's local map will diverge — that is fine, identifiers
  are stable per-value via the deterministic hash, so two
  developers redacting the same body produce the same identifier
  text without sharing the file.
- The map is append-only in normal operation. No cleanup tool
  ships with the framework; manual `rm` is supported but loses
  the reverse mapping (the agent has to re-fetch source data to
  rebuild on demand).

## The redact-then-reveal lifecycle

```text
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
fetch (Gmail / ──┤  raw body + PII     │
PonyMail)        └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │  pii-redact (TYPE inference per field)
                            ▼
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │  body w/ identifiers│ ◄─── this is what
                 └──────────┬──────────┘      Claude / any
                            │                 downstream LLM sees
                            │
                  …agent processing,
                  draft composition,
                  cross-skill handoff…
                            │
                            ▼
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │  draft w/ identifiers│
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │  pii-reveal (only at outbound boundary)
                            ▼
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │  draft w/ real names│ ──► sent to reporter
                 └─────────────────────┘
```

Three rules govern the lifecycle:

1. **Redact immediately after fetch.** Before any LLM-bound step
   touches the content — including Claude's own context — the
   skill calls `pii-redact`. The window between fetch and redact
   should be a single tool call wide.
2. **Operate on identifiers throughout.** All intermediate work
   (analysis, summarization, draft composition, prior-art lookup)
   runs against `N-a3f9d2`-style text. Skills that compose a draft
   for the reporter use the identifier in the draft body and only
   reverse it as the last step.
3. **Reveal only at the outbound boundary.** `pii-reveal` runs
   exactly once per draft, at the moment the rendered draft is
   handed to the send / draft-create tool. It does not run while
   the agent is *thinking about* the draft — only when the bytes
   are leaving the framework.

## How skills call the redactor

Two console scripts, both reading stdin and writing stdout:

```bash
# Redact: replace real PII with identifiers; map updated in place.
echo "$BODY" | uv run --project <framework>/tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-redact \
  --field name:"Jane Smith" \
  --field email:"jane.smith@example.com" \
  --field phone:"+1-555-0100"

# Reveal: replace identifiers with real values from the local map.
echo "$DRAFT" | uv run --project <framework>/tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-reveal
```

`pii-redact` takes one or more `--field <type>:<value>` arguments
declaring what to redact (the skill knows which header / signature
field carried which value). The redactor finds those exact
substrings in the input and swaps them.

`pii-reveal` reads the input, scans for `<TYPE>-<hex>` patterns
that match entries in the mapping file, and substitutes them with
the stored real values. Identifiers not in the map are left
unchanged — the skill knows it didn't redact those values, so they
must be either someone else's redaction (not reversible here) or
incidental text.

A third console script lists the current map for debugging:

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-list
# →  N-a3f9d2  name      Jane Smith
#    E-b8c247  email     jane.smith@example.com
#    …
```

Skill files reference the same invocation via the `<framework>`
placeholder — see
[`AGENTS.md` — placeholder convention](../../AGENTS.md#placeholder-convention-used-in-skill-files).

## Determinism, idempotency, collisions

- **Deterministic** — `pii-redact name:"Jane Smith"` produces
  the same `N-a3f9d2` on every machine, every run, because the
  identifier is `N-` + first-24-bits of `sha256("jane smith")`.
  The mapping file is convenience storage for `pii-reveal`; the
  identifier itself is reproducible without it.
- **Idempotent** — running `pii-redact` twice on the same input
  with the same `--field` values writes the mapping file once
  and produces identical output the second time.
- **Collision-resistant** — at the 6-char default, two distinct
  inputs mapping to the same prefix is a one-in-16-million event
  per (type, prefix) pair. When it happens, the redactor extends
  the second-detected value's hash by 2 hex chars at a time
  (`N-a3f9d2ab`, then `N-a3f9d2abcd`, …) until the new identifier
  is unique against the current map. Extension is permanent for
  that mapping entry — once `N-a3f9d2ab` is in the file, that
  value keeps the longer form forever.

## What never reaches an LLM

- The contents of `~/.config/apache-magpie/pii-mapping.json`. The
  file is read by `pii-redact` / `pii-reveal` only. Skills MUST
  NOT include the mapping in any LLM-bound prompt, summary, or
  status comment. If you need to debug what mapped to what, run
  `pii-list` in the user's terminal — that output goes to the
  user's screen, not to Claude's context.
- The `--field <type>:<value>` arguments themselves, if a skill
  ever emits its tool-call arguments into a status comment. The
  arguments are PII by construction — every value passed there is
  exactly what the redactor is replacing.
- Any draft text *before* `pii-reveal` runs, if the test path
  short-circuits and skips reveal — the draft body would still
  carry identifiers, which leak no PII, but skills should not
  emit identifier-laden drafts to non-internal destinations
  (e.g. a public PR comment) by accident. The
  [`models.md`](models.md) gate is a separate safety net for
  this — its destination check ensures non-approved destinations
  see neither raw PII nor stale identifiers.
