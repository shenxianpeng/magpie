# redactor

Stdlib-only Python project implementing the PII redactor for
the Magpie privacy-llm tool. Three console scripts:

| Console script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pii-redact` | Replace declared PII values in stdin with hash-prefixed identifiers; persist new mappings to the local file. |
| `pii-reveal` | Replace identifiers in stdin with stored real values from the local mapping. |
| `pii-list` | Print the current mapping for debugging (text or JSON). |

The behavioural contract — which fields count as PII, the
identifier format, the redact-then-reveal lifecycle — lives in
[`../pii.md`](../pii.md). This README covers local-setup and
day-to-day invocation.

## Run

From the framework's root (this repository when running standalone;
the snapshot path inside an adopting tracker repo):

```bash
# Redact: pass --field <type>:<value> for each PII value to swap.
# `name:` is for any natural-person name OTHER than the reporter
# and other than current <tracker> collaborators (see ../pii.md).
echo "I worked with Other Researcher (other@example.com) on this finding" | \
  uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-redact \
    --field name:"Other Researcher" \
    --field email:"other@example.com"
# →  I worked with N-<hex> (E-<hex>) on this finding

# Reveal: identifiers in stdin → real values from the local map.
echo "Reply mentions N-<hex>" | \
  uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-reveal
# →  Reply mentions Other Researcher

# List the current map (text or JSON):
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-list
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-list --format json
```

Skill files reference the same invocation via the `<framework>`
placeholder so the path resolves in either context:

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/privacy-llm/redactor pii-redact ...
```

`<framework>` substitutes to the snapshot path inside an adopting
project (typically `.apache-magpie/apache-steward/`) and to `.`
when running standalone — see the placeholder convention in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md#placeholder-convention-used-in-skill-files).

Field types accepted by `--field`:

| Friendly name | Code | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `N` | Natural-person name of a non-reporter, non-collaborator individual the reporter mentions. |
| `email` | `E` | Email address of the same. |
| `phone` | `P` | Phone number of the same. |
| `ip` | `IP` | IPv4 or IPv6 address self-disclosed by a third party. |
| `handle` | `H` | Personal social handle (GitHub, Twitter, IRC nick, …) of the same. |
| `address` | `A` | Postal / employer address of the same. |

## Mapping file

The mapping is stored at:

```text
~/.config/apache-magpie/pii-mapping.json     (default)
$PII_MAPPING_PATH                             (env override)
--mapping-path <path>                         (per-call override)
```

The file is written with mode `0o600`, atomically (`tempfile +
os.replace`). It is per-machine, never committed. The
identifier-from-value derivation is deterministic, so two
developers redacting the same value get the same identifier
without sharing the file.

## Test

```bash
# Run the test suite:
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor --group dev pytest

# With coverage (if you add coverage.py to the dev group locally):
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor --group dev pytest --cov=redactor
```

## Lint / type-check

```bash
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor --group dev ruff check src tests
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor --group dev ruff format --check src tests
uv run --project tools/privacy-llm/redactor --group dev mypy
```
