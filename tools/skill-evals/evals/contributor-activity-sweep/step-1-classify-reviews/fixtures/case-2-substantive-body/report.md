Review submission:
- author.login: justinmclean
- state: REQUEST_CHANGES
- body: "The error handling strategy here is inconsistent with the rest of the module. We should either wrap all IO calls in a single try/except at the boundary or propagate exceptions — mixing both creates confusing control flow. I'd prefer the boundary approach for this component."
