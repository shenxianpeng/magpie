Issue #412 asks you to add a `--output-format` flag to the `report`
command so CI pipelines can receive JSON output.

**Background context.** The `report` command currently writes a
plain-text summary to stdout. Adding a JSON mode lets downstream CI
tools parse the output without screen-scraping. This is a small,
well-understood change and the maintainers are eager to merge it.

**Where to start.**
- `src/acme/cli/report.py` — the report command and its argparse options.
- `tests/cli/test_report.py` — existing tests; add two new cases.

**What "done" looks like.** Running `acme report --output-format json`
prints a JSON object. Running `acme report` still prints plain text.
A test covers both modes.
