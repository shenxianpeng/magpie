Messages (chronological):
  1. contributor (eve): "Why does the build require Python 3.9 minimum?"
  2. agent (why-question answer): "@eve — Python 3.9 is the minimum because
     Airflow 2.x relies on `zoneinfo`, introduced in 3.9. See the
     [supported versions policy](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/prerequisites.html).

  3. contributor (eve): "I don't think that policy makes sense for my use
     case."
  4. agent: "@eve — The minimum version is set project-wide and applies to
     all contributions. A maintainer can discuss exceptions.

  5. contributor (eve): "Can a real person from the team please look at this?
     I've been going in circles."
