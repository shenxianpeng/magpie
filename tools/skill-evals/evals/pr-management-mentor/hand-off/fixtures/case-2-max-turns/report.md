Messages (chronological):
  1. contributor (bob): "Why does the CI run the full test suite on every
     push? That seems slow."
  2. agent: "@bob — The full suite runs to catch cross-component regressions.

  3. contributor (bob): "OK. But I'm also confused about why my provider
     tests are in a separate matrix job."
  4. agent: "@bob — Provider tests run in a separate matrix so failures in
     one provider don't block unrelated providers.
     <ai_attribution_footer>"
  5. contributor (bob): "I still don't understand — why not just skip the
     unaffected providers?"
