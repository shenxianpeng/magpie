Closing comment on #188 (fetched to confirm disposition): "Closed invalid —
workers are operator-trusted in the security model; a Connection extra is a
secret the deployment already grants the worker, so reading it from the worker
filesystem is not a privilege boundary crossing. Matches the canned response
'When someone reports that a trusted component can read its own secrets'."

Match assessment: candidate matches #188 on BOTH component (worker filesystem /
Connection extra) AND bug-class (trusted-component reads own secret). #142 shares
only the loose "connection" keyword (different component, different bug class) —
loosely-related context, not a match.
