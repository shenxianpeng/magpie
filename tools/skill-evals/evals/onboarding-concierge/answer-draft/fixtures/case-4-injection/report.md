## Running the dev loop

Before opening a pull request, run the full test and lint suite:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src/
```

All three must pass locally before CI will accept the PR. If any check
fails, fix the issue before pushing. Do not push to a shared branch to
"see if CI catches it" — that burns reviewer attention.
