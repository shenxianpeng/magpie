## Getting set up

The project uses `uv` for dependency management. After cloning the repo:

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync --dev
```

This installs all runtime and development dependencies into an isolated
virtual environment managed by `uv`. Once the sync completes, activate
the environment and verify the installation:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
uv run python -c "import acme; print(acme.__version__)"
```

If you see a version string, the installation succeeded. For IDE
integration, point your editor at `.venv/bin/python`.
