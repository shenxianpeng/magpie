# security-tracker-stats-dashboard

**Capability:** capability:stats

Generate a self-contained HTML dashboard of `<tracker>` repository
statistics — issue-lifecycle bands (untriaged / triaged / PR-merged /
fixed-released / closed-other), opened-vs-untriaged backlog, cumulative
opened/closed, and mean-time-to-triage / first-response / PR-open /
PR-merge / advisory-announced.

All charts are line / area (no bars) with `connectgaps: true`. Plotly
loaded via CDN — the output HTML is self-contained but viewing it
requires network access for the chart library.

The tool is **read-only on GitHub** — it does not create or modify
issues, comments, labels, or PRs. It only fetches data via `gh` and
renders an HTML file.

The companion agentic skill at
[`.claude/skills/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/SKILL.md)
wraps this tool and surfaces it through Claude Code's slash-command
interface; both routes (script-only and skill-driven) run the same
fetch + render pipeline.

## Invocation

```bash
bash <framework>/tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/run.sh [<output-path>]
```

Env knobs (all optional):

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TRACKER_STATS_REPO` | *(e.g. `airflow-s/airflow-s`)* | `<tracker>` repo slug |
| `TRACKER_STATS_OUT` | `/tmp/airflow_s_monthly.html` | output HTML path |
| `TRACKER_STATS_CACHE` | `/tmp/tracker-stats-cache` | fetch cache dir |
| `TRACKER_STATS_CONFIG` | *(unset)* | path to a YAML overlay file |
| `TRACKER_STATS_BUCKETS` | *(from config: `monthly`)* | `monthly` or `quarterly` |
| `TRACKER_STATS_START` | *(from config: `null`)* | `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-Qn` |
| `TRACKER_STATS_UPSTREAM_REPO` | *(from config; e.g. `apache/airflow`)* | `<upstream>` repo slug; `none` skips PR charts |

### Resume behaviour

Each fetch script resumes from cache, so re-running after a partial
failure (rate limit, transient HTTP error) only re-fetches what is
missing. Delete the cache dir to force a fresh full fetch.

Fetches are parallelised (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, ~10 workers). A fresh
run is ~5–10 minutes on a 250-issue tracker; incremental re-renders
(cache warm) are ~30 seconds.

## Configuration

`render.py` loads configuration in this order, highest priority last:

1. `default-config.yaml` (in this directory).
2. `$TRACKER_STATS_CONFIG` overlay YAML, when set (typically
   `<adopter-repo>/.apache-steward-overrides/security-tracker-stats.yaml`).
   Deep-merged with the default. **The `milestones` and `categories`
   lists are REPLACED entirely** (not concatenated) — overlaying a
   single category requires re-stating the whole list.
3. Env-var quick overrides for the most common knobs:
   `TRACKER_STATS_BUCKETS`, `TRACKER_STATS_START`,
   `TRACKER_STATS_UPSTREAM_REPO`.

See [`default-config.yaml`](default-config.yaml) for the full schema
with inline documentation of every predicate key.

### Categories (lifecycle bands)

Mutually-exclusive states per tracker at each bucket-end snapshot,
evaluated **top-to-bottom** with first-match-wins. Multiple rules can
share a `name` to express disjoint branches of the same final
category — the default set uses this for the `open / closed`
fork on `fixed_released`. The set of distinct names defines the
stack order in the lifecycle chart (overridable via the
`stack_order:` config key).

Supported predicate keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `state` | `open` / `closed` |
| `state_reason` | `COMPLETED` / `NOT_PLANNED` / `REOPENED` / `null` |
| `any_label` | at least one of the listed labels is present |
| `all_labels` | every label in the list is present |
| `not_label` | the named label must NOT be present |
| `not_any_label` | none of the listed labels present |
| `no_scope_label` (`true`/`false`) | tracker carries none of `scope_labels` |
| `has_scope_label` (`true`/`false`) | tracker carries at least one of `scope_labels` |
| `pr_merged_by_snapshot` (`true`/`false`) | a linked `<upstream>` PR is merged by the snapshot timestamp |
| `any_of` / `all_of` | logical combinators (nestable) |

Snapshot reconstruction replays each tracker's event stream
(labeled / unlabeled / closed / reopened) chronologically from
`{labels: [], state: OPEN}` at `createdAt`, evaluated at the
bucket-end timestamp (Mar 31 / Jun 30 / Sep 30 / Dec 31 at 23:59:59 UTC
for quarterly; calendar-month last day for monthly).

### Time-to-triage signal

First tracker comment whose author is on the roster (from
`fetch_roster.py`) AND whose body matches any
`triage.keywords[]` regex (case-insensitive). Falls back to
the **first non-bot roster comment** when no keyword matches
(useful for older trackers that predate the team's triage-comment
convention). The `triage.bot_prefixes[]` list skips automated
rollup / sync / import comments.

### Milestones (vertical annotations)

`milestones[]` produces a vertical dashed line + top-label annotation
on every time-axis chart. Each entry needs `date: YYYY-MM-DD` (mapped
onto the bucket axis) and `label`. Set `milestones: []` in an overlay
to remove them entirely.

### When `upstream_repo` is null

The `c_prc` / `c_prm` / `c_rel` PR-driven mean-time charts are
omitted, the `fetch_prs.py` stage is a silent no-op, and the
`pr_merged_by_snapshot` predicate is always false (so the
`open_pr_merged` snapshot back-fill rule is disabled). The
remaining charts still render.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` authenticated with read access to `<tracker>` (and to
  `<upstream>` for PR metadata, when configured).
- `python3` (3.9+).
- `jq` (only used by the fetch scripts via gh's `--jq` flag).
- Network access to `api.github.com` and (for viewing) Plotly's CDN.
- Optional: `pyyaml`. When missing, `render.py` falls back to a
  bundled minimal YAML subset parser sufficient for
  `default-config.yaml` and typical overlays. To pin a clean PyYAML
  invocation, set `TRACKER_STATS_PY=uv-yaml` and the orchestrator
  runs every step under `uv run --with pyyaml`.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `events/<N>.json` missing for some N | gh transient failure during paginate | Re-run `run.sh`; `fetch_events.py` resumes from cache |
| `prs.json` has `{"error": ...}` entries | False-positive body parse (PR# doesn't exist) | Silently filtered at render; safe to ignore |
| `c_rel` median jumps after re-fetch | New advisory shipped since last run | Expected — re-render is correct |
| Empty `c_prc` / `c_prm` / `c_rel` early buckets | No linked PR in those tracker buckets | Expected — not all early trackers had a fix PR |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: yaml` | PyYAML missing | The bundled fallback parser handles `default-config.yaml`; for richer overlays install pyyaml or use `TRACKER_STATS_PY=uv-yaml` |
