# `sandbox-lint`

**Capability:** capability:setup

Lints `.claude/settings.json` against the shipped baseline at
`tools/sandbox-lint/expected.json`, and against the security
invariants documented in `docs/security/threat-model.md`
(mitigation **M.29**). The threat-model document lands in a
companion PR; the lint stands on its own and runs immediately on
merge.

## What it checks

1. **Baseline parity.** Every key/value in the live settings file
   must match the baseline. Lists tagged as set-typed (`denyRead`,
   `allowRead`, `allowWrite`, `allowedDomains`, `deny`, `ask`) are
   compared as sets so a re-order does not trip the lint, but every
   addition or removal does. Any drift fails CI.
2. **Hard invariants.** Independent of the baseline, the live
   settings must satisfy the security boundaries the threat model
   commits to:
   - `sandbox.enabled` is `true`.
   - `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` contains `~/`.
   - `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` contains no credential or root
     paths (`~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.docker`, `~/.kube`,
     `~/.azure`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `/`, `~/`).
   - `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` is a subset of `allowRead` and
     contains no credential, config-root, or homedir-root path.
   - `permissions.deny` contains the verbatim entries listed in
     [`src/sandbox_lint/__init__.py`](src/sandbox_lint/__init__.py)
     (`REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS_DENY`).
3. **Baseline self-check.** The same invariants are applied to
   `expected.json` itself, so a PR cannot weaken the baseline in
   lockstep with the live settings without the lint catching the
   underlying boundary violation.

## How to use

Run from the repository root:

```sh
uv run --directory tools/sandbox-lint --group dev sandbox-lint
```

Run with explicit paths (useful for tests):

```sh
uv run --directory tools/sandbox-lint --group dev sandbox-lint \
  --settings .claude/settings.json \
  --expected tools/sandbox-lint/expected.json
```

Exit code is `0` on a clean pass, `1` on any invariant violation or
baseline drift.

## CI wiring

The lint runs in two places:

- The
  [`sandbox-lint`](../../.github/workflows/sandbox-lint.yml)
  GitHub Actions workflow, on every PR that touches
  `.claude/settings.json`, the baseline, or the lint code itself.
- The repository's `prek` config
  ([`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../../.pre-commit-config.yaml)) runs
  `pytest`, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, and `mypy` against
  this project, so contributors hit the same checks locally.

## Updating the baseline

Any legitimate edit to `.claude/settings.json` must be paired with
the same edit to `tools/sandbox-lint/expected.json` in the same PR.
This is the explicit acknowledgement that mitigation M.29 requires:
two files, two edits, one review surface. The lint refuses to pass
if the two diverge.

## Residual risk

A maintainer running an agent locally can edit `.claude/settings.json`
to weaken the sandbox without ever opening a PR. This lint catches
the *shipped* configuration but not local overrides during a single
agent run. The companion threat-model document records this under
section *X3, Sandbox bypass via developer override* and *Residual
risk #4*; consult that document once it lands on `main`.
