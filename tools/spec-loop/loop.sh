# Spec-driven build loop for this repository.
#
# A small loop in the general "Ralph" style (run a fresh agent context
# against a prompt, repeat), adapted to this framework's posture:
#
#   * FOUR modes, ONE mechanism:
#       ./loop.sh                 build, unlimited iterations
#       ./loop.sh 20              build, max 20 iterations
#       ./loop.sh build [N]       build, max N iterations (N=0/omitted = unlimited)
#       ./loop.sh plan [N]        gap-analysis only, updates the plan (default 1 pass; N=0 unlimited)
#       ./loop.sh update [N]      back-fill specs from code others contributed (default 1 pass; N=0 unlimited)
#       ./loop.sh consolidate [N] shrink the plan (default 1 pass; N=0 unlimited)
#       ./loop.sh -h | --help     show usage and exit
#   * BRANCH PER WORK ITEM: before each build iteration the loop returns
#     to the integration base; the build prompt then carves out
#     <slug> for the one work item it implements. One work item =
#     one branch = one PR.
#   * NEVER pushes, NEVER opens a PR. `git push` / `gh pr create` are in
#     .claude/settings.json `ask` — they are the human's step. The loop
#     ends at a local commit and the build prompt prints the human-run
#     push + `gh pr create --web` commands.
#   * NO REDOING BUILT WORK: because the loop never pushes, a work item it
#     already built exists only as a LOCAL BRANCH and has no open PR. Each
#     iteration therefore feeds the agent BOTH the open PRs and the local
#     work-item branches as in-flight work. Without the local-branch signal
#     the agent would re-pick the same top-priority plan item every
#     iteration and rebuild it forever (an endless loop).
#
# SECURITY — read before running:
#   This loop runs the agent in each harness's unattended / auto-approval mode
#   (for example Claude's `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Codex's
#   `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, Cursor's `--force`, or
#   Gemini's `--yolo`). That bypasses the agent permission layer but NOT the
#   external OS sandbox (clean-env + filesystem/network). Per the project's
#   security model it MUST be launched inside the sandbox harness, with no
#   push/write credentials in the environment. Full rationale:
#   docs/spec-driven-development.md § Security and unattended agent loops.
#
# Stop gracefully: press Ctrl+C, or `touch STOP` (exits after the current
# iteration finishes).
#
# Env overrides:
#   SPEC_LOOP_BASE   branch to fork work items from (default: main)
#   SPEC_LOOP_AGENT  agent CLI to run (default: claude). Any supported
#                    headless agent CLI works; the invocation convention is
#                    chosen by SPEC_LOOP_HARNESS below.
#   SPEC_LOOP_HARNESS  which harness's headless-run convention to use when
#                    invoking SPEC_LOOP_AGENT: `claude` (default), `codex`,
#                    `cursor`, `gemini`, or `opencode`. Defaults from the
#                    agent basename, so setting SPEC_LOOP_AGENT=codex,
#                    SPEC_LOOP_AGENT=cursor-agent, SPEC_LOOP_AGENT=gemini, or
#                    SPEC_LOOP_AGENT=opencode is usually enough.
#   SPEC_LOOP_MODEL  model passed to the agent CLI. Defaults to `sonnet` for
#                    Claude; all other harnesses use their configured default
#                    unless this is set.
#   SPEC_LOOP_PR_LIMIT  open PRs to list for duplicate-work checks (default: 100)
#   SPEC_LOOP_PLAN_MAX  plan line count that triggers ONE consolidation
#                    round before building (default: 500)
