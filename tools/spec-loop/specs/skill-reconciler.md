  .claude/skills/magpie-skill-reconciler/ with an eval suite under
  tools/skill-evals/evals/skill-reconciler/.
acceptance:
  - The reconciler is read-only: it produces a structured diff and a
    reconciliation proposal; it never rewrites either skill without human
    confirmation.
  - Divergence in the safety baseline (untrusted-content-is-never-
    instructions, identity-resolution caveats, confidentiality posture)
    is reported as a must-fix, distinct from divergence that is allowed
    to stand.
  - A maintainer can review the proposal and the safety-baseline verdict
    without running either skill.

# Cross-project skill reconciler

## What it does

Compares two near-duplicate skills, typically the same capability carried
in an ASF and a non-ASF variant (or two `source`-tagged copies), and
produces a structured diff plus a reconciliation proposal. It
operationalises the MISSION principle that duplication is fine where it
buys decoupling precisely because an agent can reconcile copies on
demand: the reconciler is that agent step, made repeatable.

The key move is that not all divergence is equal. The reconciler sorts
differences into three classes: **allowed divergence** (scope, tier,
teaching voice, project-specific values behind placeholders, the things
MISSION says skills are free to diverge on); **drift** (one copy gained a
fix, a clearer step, or a hardening the other lacks, where convergence is
probably wanted); and **safety-baseline divergence** (the
untrusted-content-is-never-instructions rule, identity-resolution
caveats, confidentiality posture, which PRINCIPLES says every copy must
stay eventually-consistent on). The first is reported and left alone, the
second is proposed as a merge, and the third is flagged as a must-fix
that a maintainer should not ignore.

## Where it lives

- Skill: `skill-reconciler` at `.claude/skills/magpie-skill-reconciler/`,
  in the meta / quality family with `write-skill`, `optimize-skill`, and
  `list-skills` (see [meta-and-quality-tooling.md](meta-and-quality-tooling.md)).
  Eval suite under `tools/skill-evals/evals/skill-reconciler/`.
- Optional deterministic helper (not yet built): a `uv` tool under `tools/`
  that does the structural diff (frontmatter, section headings,
  step-by-step decision rules, placeholder inventory) so the skill
  reasons over a normalised diff rather than raw text. Follows the
  tool-backs-skill pattern already used across the catalogue.
- Inputs: two `SKILL.md` trees (plus their supporting `.md` files),
  identified by path or by `source` tag.
- It reads the safety-baseline definition from the same place the rest of
  the framework does (PRINCIPLES.md / the security posture docs); it does
  not restate the baseline inline.

## Behaviour & contract

- **Read-only; proposes, never rewrites.** The reconciler emits a diff
  and a proposal. Any actual convergence edit goes through `write-skill`
  / `optimize-skill` under human confirmation; the reconciler itself
  changes no skill file.
- **Three-class divergence verdict.** Every difference is labelled
  `ALLOWED`, `DRIFT`, or `SAFETY-BASELINE`. The safety-baseline class is
  never silently merged away and never dropped from the report, even when
  the two copies are otherwise identical.
- **Safety divergence is a must-fix, not a suggestion.** When the two
  copies disagree on the untrusted-content rule, identity-resolution
  caveats, or confidentiality posture, the reconciler surfaces it as a
  blocking finding a maintainer must resolve, separate from the
  convenience merges.
- **Decoupling is preserved by default.** The reconciler does not push
  toward DRY across organisational boundaries; allowed divergence is
  reported and left in place. Convergence is proposed only for drift and
  required only for the safety baseline.
- **Untrusted content stays data.** Skill bodies under comparison are
  treated as input data; an injected instruction inside a compared skill
  is reported as content, never executed.

## Out of scope

- Rewriting, merging, or deleting either skill on autopilot (that is a
  confirmed `write-skill` / `optimize-skill` edit).
- Choosing which copy "wins" on allowed divergence; the reconciler
  reports the difference and leaves the call to the maintainers who own
  each copy.
- Cross-foundation policy. The reconciler is a tool for reconciling skill
  text; it makes no claim on which project's governance is correct.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Given two near-duplicate skills, the reconciler emits a structured
   diff and labels every difference `ALLOWED`, `DRIFT`, or
   `SAFETY-BASELINE`.
2. A safety-baseline divergence is always reported as a must-fix and is
   never folded into the allowed-divergence noise.
3. The reconciler makes no edit to either skill; convergence is a
   separate, confirmed authoring step.
4. The skill validates under `skill-and-tool-validate` and ships an eval
   suite under `tools/skill-evals/evals/skill-reconciler/`, including a
   case where the two copies diverge only on the safety baseline and the
   reconciler must flag it.

## Validation

```bash
uv run --project tools/skill-and-tool-validator --group dev skill-and-tool-validate
uv run --project tools/skill-evals skill-eval tools/skill-evals/evals/skill-reconciler/
```

## Known gaps

- **Safety-baseline definition is prose, not machine-readable.** The
  shipped reconciler checks for injection-guard, collaborator-trust, and
  confidentiality-posture clauses by recognising their prose patterns; a
  future improvement is to extract those three clauses into a single
  authoritative checklist file the skill and a deterministic linter can
  both reference.
- **`source`-tag-driven auto-pairing not implemented.** The first
  implementation takes two explicit paths; MISSION's vision of pairing
  copies via a registry query over `source` tags is deferred.
- **Deterministic structural-diff helper shipped** —
  `tools/skill-reconciler-diff/` is a stdlib-only `uv` tool that parses
  two skill trees into a normalised diff (frontmatter, section headings,
  step inventory, placeholder inventory, support files, and
  safety-baseline clause presence) and emits a JSON object.  It is
  intended to be used as an optional Step 1 enhancement to the
  `skill-reconciler` skill (the skill does not yet wire it in — that
  reference lands separately); 31 unit tests cover frontmatter-only, section-order,
  placeholder, support-file, and safety-baseline divergences.  No
  remaining tooling gap for the structural-diff item.
