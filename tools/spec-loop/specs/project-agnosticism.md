status: experimental
kind: feature
mode: infra
source: >
  MISSION.md § Abstract and § Affordability and vendor neutrality
  ("'project' means both an ASF PMC and any non-ASF community, neither is
  a second-class citizen"). README.md § Skill families. The placeholder +
  adapter contract in adapters.md and adoption-and-setup.md, and the
  backend-flag model proven in docs/release-management/ (distribution /
  approval / announcement backends).
acceptance:
  - No shipped skill hardcodes an ASF-only assumption a non-ASF adopter
    cannot satisfy; every ASF-specific surface is a placeholder, an
    adapter backend, or a capability-flag branch with a documented
    non-ASF path and a sensible default.
  - Behavioural branches that differ by ecosystem (list vote vs
    PR-approval, svn dist vs github-releases, ICLA vs DCO, mailing-list
    intake vs GitHub discussion) are selected by a declared
    `<project-config>` flag, not by editing the skill.
  - The catalogue stays runnable by an ASF adopter unchanged: ASF is the
    default profile, not a removed one.

# Project-agnosticism (de-ASF coupling)

## What it does

Keeps the skill catalogue usable by any open-source community, not just
ASF projects, by ensuring every ASF-specific assumption lives behind one
of three generalisation mechanisms rather than being baked into a skill.
MISSION makes non-ASF adopters first-class; this area is the standing
audit and the mechanism that holds that promise as the catalogue grows.

The three mechanisms, in order of preference:

1. **Placeholders** for project-specific *values* (`<tracker>`,
   `<upstream>`, `<security-list>`, `<default-branch>`, …), resolved from
   `<project-config>/`. This is the default and already widely used.
2. **Adapters** for swapping the backing *system* a step talks to
   (`tools/gmail`, `tools/ponymail`, `tools/jira`, `tools/github`,
   `tools/mail-source`). See [adapters.md](adapters.md).
3. **Capability / backend flags** for the harder case: a step whose
   *workflow itself* differs by ecosystem. The adopter declares the
   profile in `<project-config>` and the skill branches on it, keeping the
   step sequence identical while only the emitted commands / wording
   change. This is the "conditional flags" mechanism, already modelled in
   `docs/release-management/` (`release_dist_backend`,
   `release_approval_mechanism`, `release_announce_backend`).

## Where it lives

- The placeholder + config-resolution contract: `adapters.md`,
  `adoption-and-setup.md`, and the adopter scaffold
  `projects/_template/`.
- The backend-flag precedent: `docs/release-management/README.md`
  (§ adopter backends) and `projects/_template/release-management-config.md`.
- The per-family **`organization:` scope** (formerly the binary
  `asf: true` / `asf: false` flag), declared in each family's scope banner
  at the top of `docs/<family>/README.md` and surfaced in the **Scope**
  column of the family tables in [`README.md`](../../../README.md#skill-families)
  and [`docs/index.md`](../../../docs/index.md#need-help-with-one-of-these-adopt-a-family-of-skills).
  An organization-scoped family declares `organization: <org>` (naming a
  directory under [`organizations/`](../../../organizations/)); an
  organization-agnostic family declares no scope key at all. Only
  **release-management** and **contributor-growth** carry
  `organization: ASF`: their *core purpose* is an ASF Foundation process
  (the release lifecycle, the contributor-to-committer path). This is a
  narrower lens than the residual-coupling audit list below — a family can
  be agnostic (no `organization:`, runs anywhere) and still carry
  ASF-flavoured *defaults* that the coupling audit tracks (security is the
  clearest case; those defaults now live in `organizations/ASF/`).
  Skills, tools, and tool adapters declare the same membership — see
  [`organizations/README.md` § Membership](../../../organizations/README.md#membership--what-can-belong-to-an-organization).
- The skills carrying residual ASF coupling to audit, by family:
  - **security** (agnostic): generic at its core, but ships an
    ASF-flavoured default profile — `security@`-style intake and the ASF
    security-team relay (`security-issue-import-via-forwarder`), CVE
    allocation assuming an ASF CNA (`security-cve-allocate`), Vulnogram as
    the CVE tool — all swappable for GHSA / MITRE-CNA via the config layer.
  - **contributor / committer growth** (`organization: ASF`):
    `committer-onboarding` (ICLA gate, PMC vote semantics, `dev@` announce),
    `contributor-nomination` (committer-vs-PMC roster framing).
  - **release-management** (`organization: ASF`): the whole ASF release
    ritual, already designed with backend flags; the audit confirms the
    non-ASF paths stay first-class as the skills land.
  - any skill whose prose names `apache.org` lists, `svn` dist trees,
    `incubator`, or ASF-only governance steps without a flag.

## Behaviour & contract

- **ASF is the default profile, never the only one.** Generalising a
  skill must not regress the ASF path; the ASF behaviour becomes the
  default value of the new flag / adapter, so an ASF adopter sees no
  change.
- **Prefer the lightest mechanism.** A value goes in a placeholder; a
  system swap goes in an adapter; only a genuine workflow fork gets a
  capability flag. Do not add a flag where a placeholder suffices.
- **Every flag has a documented non-ASF path.** A capability flag that
  only enumerates ASF options (e.g. an approval mechanism with just
  `dev-list-vote`) is incomplete; it must name at least one non-ASF
  option (`pr-approval`, `maintainer-roster`, `github-discussion`, …) and
  describe the adopter-facing default.
- **Advisory, not paternalistic.** The audit surfaces candidate coupling
  for a maintainer to judge; some ASF strings are legitimate (examples,
  the ASF default profile, ASF-specific docs). It does not auto-rewrite.
- **Template and example profiles stay comparable.** `projects/_template/`
  is the adopter contract; `projects/non-asf-example/` is the proof that
  a non-ASF adopter can satisfy that contract. Required files and config
  keys should be structurally comparable, with omissions explained rather
  than silently drifting.

## Out of scope

- Removing or de-prioritising ASF support: ASF is the reference adopter
  and the default profile.
- The privacy gate and sandbox ([privacy-llm-gate.md](privacy-llm-gate.md),
  [agent-isolation-sandbox.md](agent-isolation-sandbox.md)), which are
  already project-agnostic.
- The runtime adapter implementations themselves (that is
  [adapters.md](adapters.md)); this area governs the *coupling audit* and
  the *flag contract*, not the adapter code.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every shipped skill is auditable for ASF coupling, and each residual
   coupling is a placeholder, an adapter backend, or a capability-flag
   branch with a non-ASF default.
2. Ecosystem-divergent workflow steps branch on a declared
   `<project-config>` flag, not on skill edits.
3. The ASF profile runs the catalogue unchanged (default-valued flags),
   and a non-ASF profile can be declared without editing any skill body.
4. The template profile and non-ASF example expose the same required
   config surfaces, except where the example documents an intentional
   omission or an organization-inherited default.

## Validation

```bash
# Advisory sweep: surface ASF-coupled tokens in skill bodies that should
# be a placeholder, an adapter backend, or a capability-flag branch.
# Expected to flag legitimate ASF-default examples too; a human judges.
grep -rInE 'apache\.org|[[:alpha:]]+@apache|\bdev@|\bannounce@|\bICLA\b|\bsvn (mv|co|commit)|\bincubator\b|Vulnogram' skills/ \
  | grep -vE '<[a-z-]+>' | head -40
uv run --project tools/skill-and-tool-validator --group dev skill-and-tool-validate
```

## Known gaps

- **ASF-coupling lint is advisory only.** Check #10 in
  `tools/skill-and-tool-validator` (SOFT category `asf_coupling`) surfaces
  coupled tokens automatically on every validator run.  As of the
  `low-confidence-asf-coupling-pass` work (mechanical cleanup + suppression
  of low-confidence hits for `organization:`-scoped families), the live
  catalogue produces **0 asf-coupling warnings**; remaining bare `PMC` /
  `ICLA` / `announce@apache.org` references are inside org-scoped skills
  where ASF-specific text is appropriate.  No remaining tooling gap — the
  lint exists and a human judges any new hits.
- **Non-ASF adopter profile fixture shipped** — `projects/non-asf-example/`
  contains a worked non-ASF profile (Velox Stream: GitHub-hosted, DCO,
  GHSA intake, MITRE CNA, GitHub Releases). The
  `tools/skill-evals/evals/non-asf-profile-smoke/` eval suite (6 cases
  across 2 steps) drives `issue-stale-sweep` through it and asserts the
  skill proceeds without any Apache-specific fields, turning acceptance #3
  into a measurable gate.
- **The capability-flag vocabulary for security intake and CVE allocation
  is now documented** in
  `projects/_template/security-intake-config.md` (intake channel,
  forwarder relay, CNA tool, allocation gate, and new
  `disclosure_governance` flags). Skills read these flags in follow-on
  updates as each flag is wired in.
- **Contributor intake and governance capability flags are now declared**
  in `projects/_template/committer-onboarding-config.md` (`icla` / `dco`
  / `no-cla` for intake; `asf-pmc` / `github-codeowners` /
  `maintainer-roster` for governance), added by the
  `capability-flags-committer-intake` work item. The `committer-onboarding`
  skill currently defaults to ASF-PMC / ICLA; a follow-on update will wire
  it to read these flags at run time. Remaining coupling in the live
  catalogue (bare `PMC`, `ICLA`, `announce@apache.org`) is surfaced by the
  advisory lint (check #10 in `skill-and-tool-validator`) for human
  judgement.
- **Template/profile drift is not mechanically checked.** The non-ASF
  example is now a real smoke fixture, but no validator compares its file
  and key surface against `projects/_template/`. A drift check should
  catch missing required files, stale documented keys, and hidden
  organization-default assumptions.
