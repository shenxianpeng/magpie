title: Agent isolation / layered sandbox
status: stable
kind: feature
mode: infra
source: >
  MISSION.md § Privacy, security and supply-chain integrity ("Clean-
  environment wrapper", "Layered sandbox by default", "Pinned, reviewed,
  signed dependencies"). Implemented in tools/agent-isolation/, the
  setup-isolated-setup-* skills, and .claude/settings.json.
acceptance:
  - Every agent subprocess runs inside an OS-level sandbox with default-
    deny filesystem reads and network egress.
  - Credential-shaped env vars are stripped before the agent execs.
  - State-mutating shell calls (git push, gh pr create, …) require a
    confirmation prompt; secrets/cred files are deny-read.

# Agent isolation / layered sandbox

## What it does

Runs every agent invocation inside a layered sandbox so that even a
successful prompt injection cannot read credentials or reach a
non-allowed host. The fallback when prompt engineering fails is the OS
saying "no".

## Where it lives

- `tools/agent-isolation/` — the harness (clean-env wrapper +
  sandbox profiles).
- `.claude/settings.json` — the `sandbox` block (filesystem
  allow/deny, network `allowedDomains`) and `permissions` (`deny` /
  `ask`).
- Skills: `setup-isolated-setup-install`, `-update`, `-verify`,
  `-doctor` (probes live sandbox restrictions — SSH-agent reachability,
  localhost port binding, docker/podman socket — and maps each to a
  numbered troubleshooting entry; read-only, never modifies settings).
- `docs/setup/secure-agent-internals.md` — the three-layer model.

## Behaviour & contract

The reference model is four layers, layered:

1. **Clean environment** — a wrapper strips the process env to a
   project-declared whitelist before exec (no `$GH_TOKEN`, `$AWS_*`,
   `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` leakage).
2. **Filesystem + network sandbox** — Linux `bubblewrap` + `socat` SNI
   proxy; macOS `sandbox-exec`. Default-deny reads outside the tree and
   egress to non-allowed hosts.
3. **Tool permissions** — the host's `permissions.deny` blocks denied
   paths/binaries (`Read(~/.ssh/**)`, `Bash(curl *)`, …).
4. **Forced confirmation** — `permissions.ask` on every state-mutating
   shell call (`git push`, `gh pr create`, `gh issue edit`, …).

Pinned system tools (`bubblewrap`, `socat`, agent CLI) are aged through a
cooldown window; bumps are PRs, not silent updates.

## Out of scope

- The human-in-the-loop *confirmation* itself (that is the modes' job);
  this area provides the OS-level enforcement underneath it.
- Editing `.claude/settings.json` (it is in the `deny` list).

## Acceptance criteria

1. Filesystem and network default-deny with explicit allow-lists.
2. The clean-env wrapper strips credential-shaped vars before exec.
3. `git push` / `gh pr create` are in `permissions.ask`; secret/cred
   files are in `permissions.deny`.

## Validation

```bash
uv run --project tools/agent-isolation --group dev pytest
python3 -c "import json,sys; s=json.load(open('.claude/settings.json')); \
  asks=' '.join(s['permissions']['ask']); \
  sys.exit(0 if 'git push' in asks and 'gh pr create *' in asks else 1)"
```

## Known gaps

- `stable`; drift shows up when a new state-mutating command is added to a
  skill without a matching `ask` rule — the plan pass flags it.
