# egress-gateway

**Capability:** capability:setup

A local **host-allowlisting HTTP(S) forward proxy** for the
apache-steward framework. It is the egress-control chokepoint: framework
tools point `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` at it, and the gateway rejects any
connection to a host that is not on its allowlist — before a socket is
opened. This is defence-in-depth for
[RFC-AI-0003](../../docs/rfcs/RFC-AI-0003.md): even if a skill or a
prompt-injection tries to send private data to an arbitrary endpoint, the
destination is blocked.

The contract (what/why) lives in [`tool.md`](tool.md); this file is the
how-to.

## Run it

```bash
# From a context that is NOT sandboxed — binding a listen socket and
# making unrestricted outbound is exactly this process's job.
uv run --project tools/egress-gateway egress-gateway          # 127.0.0.1:8899
uv run --project tools/egress-gateway egress-gateway --port 9000
```

proxy.py keeps runtime state under `$HOME/.proxy`; if HOME is not writable
in your environment, point it somewhere writable for this process:

```bash
HOME=/tmp/egress-home uv run --project tools/egress-gateway egress-gateway
```

## Point tools at it

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8899
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8899
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

Every framework tool that uses Python `urllib` (ponymail, whimsy, jira, …)
honours these automatically — no code change. Persist them per-machine in
`.claude/settings.local.json`'s `env` block (never committed — the gateway
is a local process).

**Sandbox interaction:** a *sandboxed* process can only reach the loopback
proxy if `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` are in `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`
(see [`docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md`](../../docs/setup/sandbox-troubleshooting.md)
→ *cannot bind to a localhost port*). Adding them is loopback-only and does
not widen the internet egress surface — that is now the gateway's job.

## The allowlist

Defaults mirror the sandbox's curated `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`
(ASF infra, GitHub, Google APIs, PyPI), suffix-matched so every
`*.apache.org` project site is covered. Extend without editing code:

```bash
EGRESS_ALLOW_EXTRA="bedrock.example.com,.internal.corp" \
  uv run --project tools/egress-gateway egress-gateway
```

Entries starting with `.` are treated as suffixes; everything else is an
exact host. Loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) is always allowed.

## Test

```bash
uv run --project tools/egress-gateway --group dev pytest
```

The allowlist policy (`host_allowed`) is a pure function and is unit-tested
directly; the proxy.py integration is intentionally not exercised in CI
(it needs to bind a port).

## Caveat — host-level, not payload-level

The gateway tunnels HTTPS via `CONNECT`; it allow/denies by **host**, not by
URL path or body. There is no TLS interception, so it cannot inspect request
payloads. That is the right model for egress *control* without MITM. If you
need per-path or content-level filtering, that is a different (heavier) tool.
