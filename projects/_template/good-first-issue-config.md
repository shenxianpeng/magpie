# TODO: `<Project Name>` — good-first-issue authoring configuration

This file configures the
[`good-first-issue-author`](../../skills/good-first-issue-author/SKILL.md)
skill (Mentoring, `experimental`). Copy it into your own
`<project-config>/good-first-issue-config.md` and replace every
`<placeholder>` with your project's value. If a required key is missing,
the skill aborts and points back here rather than guessing.

## Identifiers

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `good_first_issue_label` | `good first issue` | The label proposed on the drafted issue. The skill proposes it; a maintainer applies it on confirmation. |
| `max_effort_hours` | `4` | Upper bound on the estimated effort a good first issue may carry. A candidate that clearly exceeds it is `scope-too-large`. |

## Getting-started link

A single link the drafted issue points a newcomer at. The skill links it
rather than paraphrasing. The link must resolve from a GitHub issue body
(not a repo-rendered file), so use an absolute URL: relative paths like
`CONTRIBUTING.md` 404 when rendered inside an issue. The link must
resolve before the skill drafts an issue; do not leave a placeholder URL
in this row.

| Trigger | Link | One-line label |
|---|---|---|
| Newcomer onboarding | `https://github.com/<upstream>/blob/<default-branch>/CONTRIBUTING.md#your-first-contribution` | How to contribute |

Pick the section of the contributing guide that is genuinely
newcomer-shaped (a "Your first contribution" / "Getting started" section,
not the top of the file, which usually lands on a doctoc TOC).

## Out-of-scope topics

The skill always declines (decision `unsuitable`) when a candidate touches
one of these. Adjust for your project; the defaults below are typical of
an Apache project.

- Security-sensitive work (vulnerabilities, CVE-adjacent, embargoed)
- Deprecation or removal timing (which release drops X)
- Licensing questions (compatibility, header policy)
- Architectural taste on a project-specific subsystem

## AI-attribution footer

Appended verbatim to every drafted issue body, disclosing AI authorship.

```markdown
---

_This issue was drafted with the help of an AI-assisted tool and reviewed by a <PROJECT> maintainer before posting. If anything here is unclear or looks wrong, say so on the issue: a real person is reading._
```

Replace `<PROJECT>` with the project's display name (read from
[`<project-config>/project.md`](project.md)).
