# TODO: `<Project Name>` — runtime invocation

How to invoke the project's runtime on a single source file. Used
by [`issue-reproducer`](../../skills/issue-reproducer/SKILL.md)
when running extracted code from issue descriptions.

The `<runtime>` placeholder resolves from the *Run a single file*
section below.

## Build prerequisite

How to build or install the project so its runtime is invocable.
Skip this section if the runtime is on `PATH` out-of-the-box.

TODO: replace with the project's actual prerequisite. Examples:

- JVM-language projects with Gradle: `./gradlew :installDist`
  followed by a `~/.<project>/<runtime>/bin/<command>` path.
- Python projects with build artefacts: `pip install -e .`.
- Shell-script projects: usually no prerequisite.
- Native binaries already on `PATH`: no prerequisite.

## Run a single file

TODO: the command that invokes the runtime on a path. Placeholders
the skill resolves at runtime:

- `<file>` — path to the source file the reproducer wrote.
- `<args>` — optional argv to pass.

Recipe:

```text
TODO-runtime <file> <args>
```

Concrete examples for common project types:

```text
# Apache Foo (a JVM scripting language): ~/.foo-runtime/bin/foo <file>
# Python project:                         python <file>
# Compiled binary already on PATH:        <project-name> run <file>
# Shell:                                  bash <file>
```

## Capture conventions

How to capture stdout, stderr, and exit code in a way the skill can
parse.

| Stream | Convention |
|---|---|
| `stdout` | TODO: usually no special handling needed |
| `stderr` | TODO: many projects emit failure indicators to stderr — capture both |
| `exit code` | TODO: 0 = success, non-zero = failure, by convention |
| `timeout` | TODO: 60s is a common default; raise for known long-running projects |

## Network and dependency handling

TODO: describe whether the runtime resolves dependencies at runtime
(Grape for JVM scripting languages, pip for Python, etc.) and how
the skill should handle resolution failures.

- If yes: the skill must check exit code AND output for resolution
  errors before claiming `passes` or `fails` — a swallowed
  resolution exception looks like the run completed but the body
  never executed.
- Where the project caches dependencies (e.g., `~/.<project>/cache/`),
  consider isolating per-campaign so the operator's everyday cache
  stays clean. The skill supports a `cache_isolation_flag` field
  declared here that it passes through on every invocation.

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `resolves_dependencies_at_runtime` | TODO: `true` or `false` |
| `cache_isolation_flag` | TODO: e.g. `-Dgrape.root=<scratch>` if applicable; omit if not |
