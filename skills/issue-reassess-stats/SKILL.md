  Read-only dashboard over a directory of `verdict.json` files
  produced by `issue-reassess` campaigns. Surfaces a health
  rating, classification distribution, partial-fix surfaces,
  oldest-unresolved buckets, and per-component breakdowns.
  Output is HTML by default; markdown fallback available.
  Read-only on tracker state; consumes campaign artefacts.
when_to_use: |
  When a maintainer asks "what's the state of the reassessment
  campaign", "give me the dashboard for the recent sweep", or
  "which issues still fail across pool runs". Also as a
  pre-release check on whether the EOL pool has dropped, and
  as a periodic health-of-the-backlog view.

# issue-reassess-stats

Read-only dashboard skill over the `verdict.json` artefacts
produced by [`issue-reassess`](../issue-reassess/SKILL.md)
campaigns. Surfaces a health rating, classification distribution,
the `still-fails-*` action tail, partial-fix surfaces, new-issue
candidates from cross-family probes, and per-component breakdowns.

The skill is the read-only counterpart to
[`issue-reassess`](../issue-reassess/SKILL.md) — both consume the
same on-disk artefacts. Where reassess **writes** verdicts (one
per candidate) and a `report.md`, this skill **renders** an at-a-
glance dashboard for the maintainer to scan.

Modelled on [`pr-management-stats`](../pr-management-stats/SKILL.md).

---

## Golden rules

**Golden rule 1 — read-only on tracker AND on campaign
artefacts.** This skill reads `verdict.json` files and emits HTML.
It does **not** modify any campaign artefact, does **not** post to
`<issue-tracker>`, does **not** re-invoke `issue-reproducer`.

**Golden rule 2 — HTML by default.** The dashboard is designed for
the *"what should I do today"* glance. Markdown and tables-only
fallbacks are available for terminal pipelines (`--markdown`,
`--tables-only`).

**Golden rule 3 — surface action candidates first.** The dashboard
opens with the still-failing-bug count and the new-issue
candidates from probes — these are where work happens. The bulk
fixed-on-master / cannot-run-* counts come second.

**Golden rule 4 — fresh read on every invocation.** The dashboard
re-reads `verdict.json` files on every run; no in-memory caching.
This makes the dashboard a coherent snapshot of the campaign
state at the moment of invocation.

**Golden rule 5 — multi-campaign reads are explicit.** When the
user points the skill at a directory that contains multiple
campaign subdirectories, it asks which one — never silently
aggregates across campaigns.

---

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented below, this skill
consults
[`.apache-magpie-local/issue-reassess-stats.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (personal, gitignored) and [`.apache-magpie-overrides/issue-reassess-stats.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (committed, project-wide)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any agent-readable
overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract.

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/`. Local modifications go in the
override file.

---

## Snapshot drift

Also at the top of every run, this skill compares the gitignored
`.apache-magpie.local.lock` (per-machine fetch) against the
committed `.apache-magpie.lock` (the project pin). On mismatch
the skill surfaces the gap and proposes
[`/magpie-setup upgrade`](../setup/upgrade.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- A campaign directory exists at the path the user supplies (or
  the project's default per
  [`<project-config>/reproducer-conventions.md`](../../projects/_template/reproducer-conventions.md)).
- That directory contains `<KEY>/verdict.json` files for the
  campaign's candidates (at least one).

No tracker access required — the skill operates entirely on
on-disk artefacts.

---

## Inputs

| Selector | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `stats <campaign-dir>` (default) | path to a campaign directory |
| `--markdown` | emit markdown instead of HTML |
| `--tables-only` | emit terminal-rendered tables only (no hero cards, no recommendations) |
| `--output <file>` | write to a file instead of stdout |
| `--component <name>` | filter the dashboard to one component |

The default output is HTML to stdout; the user pipes it to a file
or opens it directly.

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. **Campaign directory exists** at the supplied path.
2. **At least one `verdict.json`** present under the directory.
3. **Override consultation** — see *Adopter overrides* above.
4. **Drift check** — see *Snapshot drift* above.

If the directory has multiple campaign subdirs (e.g., the user
pointed at `<scratch>/`), prompt which to use.

---

## Step 1 — Fetch the verdicts

Read every `verdict.json` under the campaign directory. Parse and
schema-validate each per
[`issue-reproducer/verdict-composition.md`](../issue-reproducer/verdict-composition.md).
Skip and report any file that fails to parse; do not aggregate
partial data.

Full details: [`fetch.md`](fetch.md).

---

## Step 2 — Classify

Bucket each verdict by `classification` (10 labels) and orthogonally
by `nature` (5 labels). Detect multi-case partial fixes from the
`cases` array. Cross-tabulate classification × nature.

Full details: [`classify.md`](classify.md).

---

## Step 3 — Aggregate

Compute the dashboard's payload:

- Total candidates, breakdown by classification and nature.
- Health rating (Healthy / Needs attention / Action needed) per
  the project's thresholds.
- Action candidates (still-failing tail).
- Closure candidates (fixed-on-master with strong evidence).
- New-issue candidates (probe findings).
- Per-component breakdown.

Full details: [`aggregate.md`](aggregate.md).

---

## Step 4 — Render

Emit the dashboard. Default is HTML with inline CSS (single self-
contained file); markdown and tables-only fallbacks honour the
`--markdown` and `--tables-only` flags.

Full details: [`render.md`](render.md).

---

## Step 5 — Output

Write to stdout (default), to a file if `--output` was passed, or
present in the agent's response if the user invoked the skill
interactively.

The HTML output is self-contained — no external CSS, no JS, no
images. A maintainer opens it in any browser without setup.

---

## Step 6 — Hand-back

Surface to the user:

- The path to the rendered output (if file mode).
- Headline numbers (count of still-failing, count of new-issue
  candidates).
- Recommended next actions:
  - For each still-failing candidate: `/magpie-issue-fix-workflow <KEY>`.
  - For each closure candidate: a manual close via the tracker.
  - For each new-issue candidate: a manual file via the tracker.

The skill never executes any of these next actions — it only
recommends.

---

## Hard rules

- **Never modify campaign artefacts.** Read-only on the campaign
  directory; no re-running `issue-reproducer`, no rewriting
  `verdict.json`.
- **Never post to `<issue-tracker>`** — the dashboard is a local
  view; tracker writes go through other skills.
- **Never aggregate across campaigns** without an explicit user
  prompt. Each campaign's verdicts are scoped to one
  `<campaign-id>`.
- **Never invent counts.** If a `verdict.json` failed to parse,
  it's surfaced as a parse error, not counted in the totals.

---

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| Campaign directory contains no `verdict.json` files | Campaign hasn't run yet, or paths are wrong | Invoke `issue-reassess` to populate, or correct the path |
| `verdict.json` parse error on N files | Schema drift, manual edits, or interrupted campaign run | Surface the failing paths; do not aggregate partial data |
| All verdicts classified `cannot-run-*` | Pool was shape-D / shape-H heavy, or runtime is broken | Surface in the dashboard's *"limitations"* section |
| Health rating threshold seems wrong for this project | Project's defaults don't match its scale | Override via `.apache-magpie-overrides/issue-reassess-stats.md` |
| Age bands don't match the project's pace | "Recent" is project-relative; defaults assume a moderately active project | Override the band edges via `.apache-magpie-overrides/issue-reassess-stats.md` |
