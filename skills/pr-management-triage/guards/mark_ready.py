"""pr-management-triage mark-ready guard (skill-contributed).

Deterministically enforces Golden rule 1b: never add the "ready for maintainer
review" label while the PR head SHA still has GitHub Actions runs awaiting
approval (the real CI has not run yet). Fail-open if the authoritative lookup
cannot be made — never block a legitimate label on a transient error.
Discovered by the agent-guard PreToolUse dispatcher; import-free (uses ``ctx``).
