# setup-override-upstream

This skill is the path from *local override* to *framework
feature*. It takes a single
`.apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md` file in an adopter
repo, walks the user through deciding whether the change is
worth upstreaming, designs the framework-level abstraction,
implements it in `apache/magpie`, and opens a PR.

The override mechanism (per
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md))
is deliberately *agentic* and *adopter-local*: there's no
schema, no anchors, no patch tool. That makes overrides
quick to write but hard to share — every adopter who wants
the same behaviour writes their own. **Upstreaming** is the
escape hatch: when an override stops being project-specific
and starts looking like a missing feature, the right move
is a PR that bakes the change into the framework's default,
making every adopter benefit on their next
`/magpie-setup upgrade`.

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented below, this
skill consults
[`.apache-magpie-local/setup-override-upstream.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (personal, gitignored) and [`.apache-magpie-overrides/setup-override-upstream.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (committed, project-wide)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any
agent-readable overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract — what overrides may contain, hard rules,
the reconciliation flow on framework upgrade, upstreaming
guidance.

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/`. Local modifications go in
the override file. Framework changes go via PR to
`apache/magpie`.

---

## Snapshot drift

Also at the top of every run, this skill compares the
gitignored `.apache-magpie.local.lock` (per-machine
fetch) against the committed `.apache-magpie.lock` (the
project pin). On mismatch the skill surfaces the gap and
proposes
[`/magpie-setup upgrade`](../setup/upgrade.md).
The proposal is non-blocking — the user may defer if
they want to run with the local snapshot for now. See
[`docs/setup/install-recipes.md` § Subsequent runs and drift detection](../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md#subsequent-runs-and-drift-detection)
for the full flow.

Drift severity:

- **method or URL differ** → ✗ full re-install needed.
- **ref differs** (project bumped tag, or `git-branch`
  local is behind upstream tip) → ⚠ sync needed.
- **`svn-zip` SHA-512 mismatches the committed
  anchor** → ✗ security-flagged; investigate before
  upgrading.

> **Doubly important here**: the skill is about to design
> a framework-level abstraction by reading the snapshot's
> framework skill. If the snapshot is stale, the
> abstraction may be designed against a version that has
> already changed upstream. Address drift before
> proceeding.

## Golden rules

**Golden rule 1 — not every override should be upstreamed.**
Many overrides encode genuinely *project-specific* choices:
the wording of a canned response, the project's scope-label
taxonomy, milestone-format regex, a tone-of-voice
preference. These should stay in the adopter repo. The
skill explicitly walks through this decision and stops
early if the change is not generalisable.

**Golden rule 2 — write to `<framework-clone>`, never to
the snapshot.** The framework PR is implemented in the
user's local apache-magpie clone (a separate working
directory from the adopter's `.apache-magpie/` snapshot,
which is gitignored and read-only). If the user does not
have a clone yet, the skill helps them set one up.

**Golden rule 3 — assistant proposes, user fires.** Per the
framework convention (see
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)), every state-changing
action — clone, branch, commit, push, `gh pr create` — is
proposed by the skill and only happens on explicit user
confirmation. Public PR content is shown to the user before
it is posted.

**Golden rule 4 — decouple PR from override deletion.**
Opening the framework PR is one step; deleting the now-
redundant override file in the adopter repo is a separate
step that happens AFTER the PR has merged AND the adopter
has run `/magpie-setup upgrade` to pick up the framework
change. The skill ends with a clear pointer at the
post-merge cleanup; it does not delete the override
preemptively.

## Walk-through

### Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. We are in an adopter repo (has
   `<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie.lock` and
   `<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie-overrides/`). If not,
   stop — the skill is for adopters with at least one
   override file.
2. The snapshot is current (no drift per the section
   above). If drift exists, propose
   `/magpie-setup upgrade` first.
3. Identify `<framework-clone>` — the user's local clone
   of `apache/magpie`. Common locations:
   `~/code/magpie/`, `~/work/magpie/`.
   If not found, surface and ask the user where it is, or
   help them clone it (`git clone
   git@github.com:apache/magpie.git`). The clone
   is **separate** from `<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/`
   (the snapshot).

### Step 1 — Pick the override

List `<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie-overrides/*.md`
(excluding the directory's own `README.md`). For each,
print the file name + first headline.

- **Zero overrides** → stop. There is nothing to upstream.
- **One override** → auto-pick.
- **Multiple** → ask the user which one to upstream this
  run. The skill handles one override per invocation
  (clean PR, clean review).

### Step 2 — Read the override + framework skill

Read the chosen override file. Surface to the user:

- Title + the override headlines (`### Override N — ...`)
- The "why" paragraph if the file has one

Then read the framework skill it modifies, from the
snapshot at
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/skills/<framework-skill>/`.
Surface:

- The skill's purpose (frontmatter description)
- The specific section(s) the override modifies (steps,
  decision-table rows, golden rules)
- Any cross-skill references the override depends on

Goal: both the user and the agent should now have a clear
mental model of *what* the change is and *where* it
applies.

### Step 3 — Decide if upstreamable

Walk through with the user. Common categories:

- **Project-specific** (canned-response wording, scope
  labels, milestone formats, tooling assumptions
  particular to this project) → **stop here**. Suggest the
  override stay local. Generalising would require the
  framework to either include the adopter's specifics
  (defeats project-agnosticism) or expose a config knob
  that no other adopter would set the same way (bloats the
  contract).
- **Missing feature** (the override does something useful
  that any adopter might want) → **continue**. The
  framework should learn this behaviour by default, or
  expose it as an opt-in.
- **Better default** (the override changes a default the
  framework currently picks; if a majority of adopters
  would prefer the override's default, the framework
  should adopt it) → **continue**. The PR may also keep
  the old behaviour reachable via a flag.
- **Refactor a step** (the framework's step is
  awkward / redundant / has an edge case) → **continue**.
  The PR fixes the step itself.

If the user is unsure, lean toward **stop** — keep the
override local until a second adopter wants the same thing.

### Step 4 — Design the framework-level abstraction

Once the user confirms the change is upstreamable, design
the framework-side change. Pick one of:

| Shape | When |
|---|---|
| **Add a config knob** in `<project-config>/` | The change is opt-in per-adopter; default behaviour is unchanged. |
| **Change a default** | The new behaviour is better for the majority; the framework's existing default becomes a `<project-config>/` opt-out. |
| **Add an optional step** | The change is an *additional* step (not a substitute for an existing one). |
| **Refactor existing step** | The change rewrites how an existing step works. No new config; the new behaviour is universal. |

Surface the proposal to the user. Iterate. The output of
this step is a concrete plan: which framework files to
modify, what to add / remove / change, what tests or
verification the framework already has that may need
updating.

### Step 5 — Implement in the framework clone

In `<framework-clone>`:

1. `git fetch origin && git checkout -b
   feat/<short-description> origin/main`
2. Apply the changes the design step decided on. Read the
   surrounding framework code first (the framework's
   `AGENTS.md`, the relevant supporting files of the
   modified skill) to match conventions.
3. Run framework pre-commit:
   `prek run --all-files`. Fix anything that fires.
4. Show the user the diff (`git diff`). Get explicit
   confirmation before committing.
5. Commit with a message matching the framework's
   conventions (Conventional-Commits prefix:
   `feat(skills): ...` for new framework behaviour,
   `refactor(skills): ...` for restructure, etc.). Use
   `Generated-by: Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.7)` trailer
   per the framework's no-coauthored-by hook.

### Step 6 — Open the PR

1. `git push -u <fork-remote> feat/<branch>`. If no fork
   remote is configured, surface and help the user add one
   (`git remote add fork <user>/magpie.git`).
2. Draft the PR title + body. Include:
   - **Summary** — what the change is, in 1–3 bullets.
   - **Motivation** — link to the originating override
     file in the adopter repo (the user's project), with
     enough context that the framework reviewer
     understands the use case without reading the full
     override.
   - **Migration path for existing adopters** — if the
     change introduces a new config knob, explain the
     default; if it changes a default, explain how
     adopters opt out.
   - **Test plan** — what the user verified locally.
3. **Confirm with the user before posting**. Show the
   exact title + body. Wait for "OK to post" / "yes" /
   "send" / similar before running `gh pr create`.
4. **Pick the labels.** Every framework PR carries at least one
   `family:*` and one `capability:*` label per
   [`docs/labels-and-capabilities.md`](../../docs/labels-and-capabilities.md).
   The override is upstreaming a change to skill `<skill>`, so:
   - `family:*` — follow the skill's family
     (`family:pr-management` for `pr-management-*`, `family:security`
     for `security-*`, `family:setup` for `setup-*`, `family:issue`
     for `issue-*`, etc.).
   - `capability:*` — the capability the change is *implementing*,
     not the file paths touched. Look up the skill's capability in
     the skill-to-capability map at
     [`docs/labels-and-capabilities.md#capability-to-skill-map`](../../docs/labels-and-capabilities.md#capability-to-skill-map).
   - Add `kind:*` and `mode:*` when they apply per the same doc.

   Surface the chosen labels in the confirmation preview alongside
   the PR title and body, so the user sees them before posting.

5. Write the PR body to a tempfile first, then create the PR:
   ```bash
   # Write tool: file_path: /tmp/override-pr-body.md, content: <PR body>
   gh pr create --repo apache/magpie --base main \
     --head <user>:<branch> --title "..." --body-file /tmp/override-pr-body.md \
     --label "family:<family>" --label "capability:<capability>"
   ```

### Step 7 — Post-PR cleanup pointer

After the PR is open, surface to the user:

```text
Framework PR opened: <PR URL>

Next steps once it merges:

  1. /magpie-setup upgrade   (in <adopter-repo>)
     - Bumps the snapshot to the new framework version.
     - .apache-magpie.lock will reflect the new pin.
  2. Delete .apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md in <adopter-repo>
     - The override is now redundant; the framework does
       what the override used to do.
  3. Commit the deletion + the bumped lock together.
```

The skill **does not** delete the override file itself —
that happens after the PR merges, and the skill cannot
predict when (or if) the framework reviewers accept the
PR. Deletion is the user's manual cleanup once the PR
lands.

## Output to the user (skill end)

```text
✓ Override picked:        .apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md
✓ Framework skill:        <framework-skill>
✓ Decision:               upstreamable as <shape from Step 4>
✓ Framework clone:        <framework-clone>
✓ Branch:                 feat/<short-description>
✓ Commits:                <count>
✓ PR opened:              <PR URL>

Next: wait for the PR to merge, then in <adopter-repo>:
  /magpie-setup upgrade
  rm .apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md
  git add -A && git commit -m "Remove override <skill>: upstreamed in apache/magpie#<N>"
```

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `<adopter-repo>` has no `.apache-magpie-overrides/` | not adopted, or adopted without the overrides scaffold | run `/magpie-setup adopt` (idempotent) |
| Step 1 finds zero overrides | nothing to upstream — adopter has no local modifications recorded | stop |
| `<framework-clone>` not found | user has not cloned `apache/magpie` yet | help them clone, then resume |
| Framework pre-commit fails after the implementation | the change does not match framework conventions | iterate with the user, re-run pre-commit, do not bypass with `--no-verify` |
| User decides mid-flow that the override is project-specific after all | wrong call in Step 3 | stop without opening a PR; the override file in the adopter repo is unchanged, no harm done |

## What this skill is NOT for

- Not for *applying* an override at run-time — that is the
  per-skill pre-flight protocol documented in
  [`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md).
- Not for *creating* a new override — that is
  [`/magpie-setup override <skill>`](../setup/overrides.md).
- Not for *upgrading* the snapshot — that is
  [`/magpie-setup upgrade`](../setup/upgrade.md).
  Run that BEFORE this skill if drift exists.
- Not for arbitrary framework PRs unrelated to overrides.
  This skill is specifically the override → PR flow. Other
  framework contributions (new skill, new tool, refactor)
  go through the framework's normal PR workflow.
