  Commit + push the user's shared Claude config to the

  pushes. Runs `git pull --rebase` first if the local checkout

  clones the default private remote if it exists, or creates a

  not. Never force-pushes; never rewrites already-pushed

when_to_use: |
  Invoke when the user says "sync my Claude config", "push my

  modifying a file in `~/.claude-config/` (scripts, CLAUDE.md,
  commands, sync.sh). Also invoke on a fresh host with no
  `~/.claude-config/` yet ("set up my shared config", "bootstrap
  my claude-config repo") — the skill clones the default remote
  or creates it. Also appropriate after

# setup-shared-config-sync

This skill propagates local edits in `~/.claude-config/` to the
sync repo's remote, so other machines can pull them. It is the
counterpart to the periodic `git pull --rebase --autostash` that
the framework's example `sync.sh` runs on a timer — that direction
pulls *upstream* into the local clone; this skill pushes *local*
modifications upstream.

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented
below, this skill consults
[`.apache-magpie-local/setup-shared-config-sync.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (personal, gitignored) and [`.apache-magpie-overrides/setup-shared-config-sync.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (committed, project-wide)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any
agent-readable overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract — what overrides may contain, hard
rules, the reconciliation flow on framework upgrade,
upstreaming guidance.

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/`. Local modifications
go in the override file. Framework changes go via PR
to `apache/magpie`.

---

## Snapshot drift

Also at the top of every run, this skill compares the
gitignored `.apache-magpie.local.lock` (per-machine
fetch) against the committed `.apache-magpie.lock`
(the project pin). On mismatch the skill surfaces the
gap and proposes
[`/magpie-setup upgrade`](../setup/upgrade.md).
The proposal is non-blocking — the user may defer if
they want to run with the local snapshot for now. See
[`docs/setup/install-recipes.md` § Subsequent runs and drift detection](../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md#subsequent-runs-and-drift-detection)
for the full flow.

Drift severity:

- **method or URL differ** → ✗ full re-install needed.
- **ref differs** (project bumped tag, or `git-branch`
  local is behind upstream tip) → ⚠ sync needed.
- **`svn-zip` SHA-512 mismatches the committed
  anchor** → ✗ security-flagged; investigate before
  upgrading.

---
## Hardcoded path

The sync repo lives at `~/.claude-config/`. This is the convention
documented in
[`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → Syncing user-scope config across machines](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#syncing-user-scope-config-across-machines).
Adopters who maintain a sync repo at a different path will need to
fork this skill — the path is intentionally not parameterised
because the doc specifies one canonical location and forking the
skill is cleaner than per-invocation path-passing.

## The default remote

When the skill has to **bootstrap** a missing `~/.claude-config/`
(see [Bootstrapping a missing `~/.claude-config/`](#bootstrapping-a-missing-claude-config)),
it resolves the remote it clones-or-creates in this order:

1. **An explicit URL the user passed this invocation** (e.g.
   *"bootstrap from `git@gitlab.com:me/claude-config.git`"*) —
   wins over everything.
2. **The default GitHub convention** — `git@github.com:<handle>/claude-config.git`,
   the SSH form the doc's
   [Setting up a fresh host](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#setting-up-a-fresh-host)
   snippet uses. `<handle>` comes from `gh api user --jq .login`
   (requires an authenticated `gh`). The repo name is `claude-config`.

If neither resolves — `gh` is missing or unauthenticated **and**
the user gave no URL — ask the user for the remote URL rather than
guessing. Any remote the skill *creates* is **private** (see the
golden rules); never public.

## Golden rules

- **Never force-push.** No `--force`, no `--force-with-lease`, no
  `--no-verify`, no rewriting commits already pushed to the
  remote. The sync repo is the source of truth between machines;
  rewriting its history risks losing work made on another
  machine that has not yet been pulled here.
- **Never modify a file outside `~/.claude-config/`.** This skill
  is scoped strictly to that one directory. If the user's
  intended change is to a file in `~/.claude/` directly (not via a
  symlink into `~/.claude-config/`), surface that and stop — the
  user wants a different action, not this skill. The **one**
  carved-out exception is the fresh-host symlink wiring during
  bootstrap (`ln -sfn ~/.claude-config/... ~/.claude/...`), and
  only after the user confirms it — see
  [Bootstrapping a missing `~/.claude-config/`](#bootstrapping-a-missing-claude-config).
- **Any remote the skill creates is private.** When bootstrap has
  to create a new remote (`gh repo create`), it always passes
  `--private` — never public, never `--internal` without the user
  asking. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` carries personal collaboration
  preferences and the scripts may reference internal paths; a
  public config repo leaks both. This mirrors the doc's *"a
  **private** git repository (private, not public …)"* rule.
- **Confirm before creating or pushing to a new remote.** Creating
  a GitHub repo and pushing the first commit is an outward-facing,
  hard-to-reverse action. Bootstrap surfaces the exact plan — repo
  name, `--private` visibility, remote URL, the files it will
  scaffold — and waits for explicit approval before running
  `gh repo create` / the initial `git push`. **Cloning** an
  already-existing remote is lower-risk (a read that writes only
  into the new `~/.claude-config/` checkout) and may proceed
  without a separate confirmation, though the skill still reports
  what it cloned.
- **Never clobber a non-repo `~/.claude-config/`.** If the path
  exists but is not a git working tree, stop and surface it — do
  not `rm` it or `git init` over it. Bootstrap only ever *creates*
  a `~/.claude-config/` that was entirely absent.
- **Pull-with-rebase first.** If `git fetch` shows the local
  checkout is behind the remote, run `git pull --rebase --autostash`
  *before* the commit + push. Concurrent work from another
  machine takes precedence; the local commit lands on top.
  This matches what the example `sync.sh` does for the periodic
  pull.
- **Draft the commit message; never auto-send.** For every
  uncommitted modification, the skill drafts a one-line commit
  subject (plus a 2–4 line body if the change merits it) and
  shows it to the user for approval. The user replies with
  *"go"* / *"yes"* / edits / *"split into two commits"* etc.
  before any `git commit` runs.
- **Use the `Generated-by:` trailer per AGENTS.md.** Commits
  authored by an agent on the user's behalf carry
  `Generated-by: Claude Code (Opus <version>)` at the end of
  the body — never `Co-Authored-By:`. See
  [AGENTS.md → Commit and PR conventions](../../AGENTS.md#commit-and-pr-conventions)
  for the canonical wording.
- **Stop on lock conflict.** The example `sync.sh` uses
  `flock --nonblock` on `~/.claude-config/.sync.lock` so two
  concurrent sync runs do not race. If `.sync.lock` is held, do
  not steal the lock — surface the conflict and stop. The other
  process is likely the user's recurring sync timer.

## Bootstrapping a missing `~/.claude-config/`

Reached from [Walk-through step 1](#walk-through) when the sync
repo is **entirely absent**. The goal is a working
`~/.claude-config/` git checkout wired to a private remote; the
skill gets there by either cloning the default remote (if it
already exists) or creating it (if it does not). It never touches
anything outside the new checkout except the confirmed fresh-host
symlink wiring at the end.

### Step B1 — resolve the remote

Resolve the default remote per
[The default remote](#the-default-remote): an explicit URL the
user passed, else `git@github.com:<handle>/claude-config.git` with
`<handle>` from `gh api user --jq .login`. If neither resolves
(`gh` missing/unauthenticated **and** no URL given), ask the user
for the remote URL and stop until they provide one — do not guess
a handle.

### Step B2 — does the remote exist?

- **GitHub default:** `gh repo view <handle>/claude-config` — exit
  `0` ⇒ exists, non-zero ⇒ does not exist (or no access; if the
  error is auth/permission rather than "not found", surface it and
  stop rather than assuming absence).
- **Explicit non-GitHub URL:** `git ls-remote <url>` — exit `0` ⇒
  exists, non-zero ⇒ does not exist / unreachable.

### Step B3a — remote exists → clone

`git clone <url> ~/.claude-config`. This is the low-risk path
(a read that only writes the new checkout), so it may proceed
without a separate create-confirmation — report the clone result.
Then continue to [Step B4 — fresh-host symlink wiring](#step-b4--fresh-host-symlink-wiring)
and resume the sync walk-through from step 2 (typically
*"in sync, nothing to do"*).

### Step B3b — remote does not exist → create + scaffold + push

Creating an outward-facing remote is confirm-first (golden rule).
**Surface the full plan and wait for explicit approval** — the
repo name, `--private` visibility, the remote URL, and the files
to be scaffolded. On approval:

1. **Create the private remote.**
   - GitHub: `gh repo create <handle>/claude-config --private --description "Personal Claude Code shared config (synced across machines)"`
     (no `--clone`, no auto-init — the local scaffold below becomes
     the first commit).
   - Non-GitHub explicit URL: the skill cannot create the remote;
     tell the user to create an **empty private** repo at that URL
     and re-invoke.
2. **Init + scaffold the minimal layout** under
   `~/.claude-config/`, matching the doc's
   [Layout](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#layout) and
   [A minimal `sync.sh`](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#a-minimal-syncsh):

   ```text
   git init -b main ~/.claude-config
   ~/.claude-config/
   ├── README.md      # what's in the repo + per-machine install steps
   ├── sync.sh        # the pull/commit/push helper (chmod +x)
   ├── scripts/       # (empty; hooks land here as the user adopts them)
   └── .gitignore     # excludes .sync.lock and any *.credentials* / secrets
   ```

   `sync.sh` is the verbatim script from the doc's
   [A minimal `sync.sh`](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#a-minimal-syncsh)
   section. `.gitignore` must at minimum carry `.sync.lock` (the
   `flock` file) so the lock never gets committed.
3. **Initial commit + push.** `git add` the scaffolded files
   individually (never `git add -A` — golden rule), commit with the
   `Generated-by:` trailer, `git remote add origin <url>`, then
   `git push -u origin main`.

### Step B4 — fresh-host symlink wiring

The new (or freshly cloned) checkout only *protects* this host once
its tracked artifacts are symlinked into `~/.claude/`. This is the
**one** write outside `~/.claude-config/` the skill performs, and
only after the user confirms. Offer to run the
[Setting up a fresh host](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#setting-up-a-fresh-host)
wiring (the `ln -sfn ~/.claude-config/… ~/.claude/…` block, which
`mv`s any pre-existing real file to `.bak` before symlinking). If
the user declines, point them at that doc section to do it
themselves. Only wire the artifacts the checkout actually
contains — on a brand-new scaffold there may be nothing under
`scripts/` yet, so this step is often a no-op beyond `CLAUDE.md`.

## Walk-through

1. **`cd ~/.claude-config`** and verify it is a git working tree
   pointing at a private remote.
   - If the directory **does not exist** at all, do not stop —
     **bootstrap** it: jump to
     [Bootstrapping a missing `~/.claude-config/`](#bootstrapping-a-missing-claude-config),
     then resume the sync walk-through from step 2.
   - If the directory **exists but is not a git repo**, surface
     that and stop (per the golden rule — never clobber a non-repo
     path). The user has a stray `~/.claude-config/`; they resolve
     it, then re-invoke.
   - If it is a git repo, continue to step 2.

2. **`git fetch origin`** to learn the remote's current state.
   Report:
   - commits behind upstream (will be pulled in step 4),
   - commits ahead of upstream (already-committed local work
     that has not yet been pushed),
   - uncommitted working-tree modifications (`git status --short`),
   - untracked files the user may want to either add or
     `.gitignore`.

3. **Decide the action.** The four reachable states:
   - **In sync, nothing to do.** No uncommitted changes, no
     unpushed commits, not behind. Report and stop.
   - **Push-only.** Already-committed local work needs to land
     on the remote, but no behind / no uncommitted edits.
     Pull-with-rebase is unnecessary; go straight to push.
   - **Commit-then-push.** Uncommitted edits exist. Walk each
     modified file with the user (diff + draft commit message
     + approval), commit each batch the user accepts, then
     push.
   - **Pull-then-commit-then-push.** Uncommitted edits *and*
     behind upstream. Run `git pull --rebase --autostash`
     first; if rebase succeeds cleanly, proceed to the
     commit-then-push flow. If rebase conflicts, stop and
     surface — conflicts in `~/.claude-config/` are the user's
     to resolve, not the skill's.

4. **Pull-with-rebase (when applicable).** Run
   `git pull --rebase --autostash`. Report what changed
   (commits pulled, files touched).

5. **Stage + commit (when applicable).** For each modification
   the user approves:
   - `git add <file>` for the specific file (never `git add -A`
     or `git add .` — the sync repo is the user's most personal
     directory and `git add -A` risks staging an editor swap
     file or a `.DS_Store` you forgot to gitignore),
   - `git commit -m '<subject>' -m '<body>'` with the
     approved message. Always include the
     `Generated-by: Claude Code (Opus <version>)` trailer in
     the body per AGENTS.md.

6. **Push.** `git push` to the upstream branch. No `--force`.
   If push is rejected (non-fast-forward) it means another
   machine pushed concurrently after our `git fetch` in step 2;
   stop, surface, and recommend re-invoking the skill (which
   will repeat the fetch + pull-with-rebase). Do not retry
   in-flight.

## After the push lands

Report:
- which commit SHA is now on the remote,
- a one-line summary of what was pushed (so the user can
  confirm in their terminal scrollback),
- whether other-machine pulls are needed (the timer-driven
  `sync.sh` on the user's other hosts will pick the change up
  on its own next run; the skill does not need to nag about
  this).

If the modifications touched a file under
`~/.claude-config/scripts/` that is symlinked from
`~/.claude/scripts/`, also note that the change is *immediately*
live on this host — the symlink resolves to the just-modified
file. No re-`cp` needed.
