"""security-issue-fix public-PR scrubbing guard (skill-contributed).

Deterministically blocks a CVE id or security-fix language in a PUBLIC
`gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` title or body — per the ASF process, the security
nature of a fix must not appear in public content before the CVE is announced.

Scoped to PR create/edit (NOT comments) on purpose, so it does not collide with
the pr-management-triage `security_language_signal` warning comment, which
deliberately quotes the matched text back to the contributor. Discovered by the
agent-guard PreToolUse dispatcher; uses only ``ctx`` + the stdlib.
